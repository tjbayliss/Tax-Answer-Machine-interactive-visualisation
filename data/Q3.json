        "text": "<div class='match' >Taxpayers may deduct ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during a tax year in carrying on a trade or business, see ¶  L-1000 et seq. But expenses paid or incurred in an activity not engaged in for profit (i.e., a hobby) are deductible only to the extent of income from the activity ( ¶  M-5800 et seq.). A question can arise as to whether taxpayers in the preparatory stage of developing an activity have the requisite profit motive either to deduct their expenses from the activity or treat them as deductible or amortizable start-up expenses (see ¶  L-5000 et seq.), as appropriate.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers, who claimed losses with respect to their horse boarding activity, were merely in the preparatory stages of the activity and not actively engaged in the activity for profit. They hadn't developed any plan by which the substantial losses attributed by them to the activity could be offset by profits from the activity. The Tax Court so held even though taxpayers had sufficient expertise to conduct a horse boarding business, consulted advisors, and expended significant time and effort.</div>\n\n<div>But a taxpayer who sought to build a larger training facility for his horses and bought land and started building the facility was engaged in the trade or business of horse racing, not merely pursuing the activity as a hobby. The taxpayer devoted sufficient time and effort to demonstrate a profit objective for the years at issue.</div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer wasn't engaged for profit in the breeding and training of cutting horses (used to herd cattle) to compete in organized events where he failed to conduct a market study before undertaking his horse activity and also failed to formulate a creditable business or profit plan. While the law doesn't require a taxpayer to engage in extensive formalities before undertaking a venture, it does require that the taxpayer conduct a basic investigation of the factors that would affect profit.</div>\n\n<div>Timber farm was a for-profit activity despite taxpayers' failure to cut and sell any of the timber during the years in issue. The Tax Court rejected IRS' argument that taxpayers' activity merely represented a startup livestock business, rather than a for-profit timber farm. IRS argued that this startup nature was established by the taxpayers' construction of a water reservoir on their farm to provide irrigation for the hay and cattle that taxpayers initially considered raising. But although taxpayers abandoned any plans to raise livestock on their farm due to the lack of adequate summer rainfall to sustain a second harvest of hay, the water reservoir related at least equally to the need to protect the trees on their timber farm from fire. The use of water reservoirs or ponds as a source of water to fight fires was a common practice in that part of Oregon.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' electric power generation activity wasn't engaged in for profit where, before the installation of the “photovoltaic system,” they failed to contact their CPA or any other reliable expert to determine whether the activity would be profitable. Taxpayers, who were actively involved in their architectural business, relied on an energy consultant to investigate the effectiveness of the system. The energy consultant didn't furnish taxpayers with any profit projections and only attempted to find a buyer for the energy who would be willing to pay the best price. Taxpayers didn't contact other buyers of the system to investigate the performance or profitability of the system. Furthermore, taxpayers agreed to buy and install the system before a utility company notified taxpayers that it wouldn't commit itself to buy energy from them. At that time, taxpayers realized that they would never make a profit on the system.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's activity of developing a wind-powered distillery for the production of ethanol wasn't engaged in for profit where his only attempt to investigate the profit potential of the project was a series of calculations that showed that under certain circumstances it would be possible to produce alcohol for fuel at a cost of $1.04 per gallon. He investigated the cost of raw materials merely by phoning a few farmers to find out the price of distressed corn. He was indifferent to the fluctuating costs of competing fuels.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer didn't engage in “capital marketing” activities as a business activity for profit where her efforts never went beyond attempts to investigate the possibility of raising capital and developing various projects. With respect to an anticancer agent, taxpayer met with people in the business community to determine the best method to structure the business organization, attract investors, develop, and commercialize the agent. Taxpayer also met with the doctor who discovered the agent to discuss the type of business arrangement needed to provide financing for his research and to determine an acceptable ownership allocation for the rights to his discovery. But taxpayer didn't enter into a formal agreement with the doctor, and her efforts to form a company to develop and commercialize the agent never materialized. As of the date of trial (about 12 years after the year at issue), taxpayer was still trying to attract investors to finance the project. Taxpayer never made any money from her efforts. Similarly, taxpayer's efforts to form a syndicate to purchase a hotel in Paris never went beyond the investigative stage. Taxpayer reviewed the hotel's financial statement and talked to an attorney who was familiar with the hotel business in Paris. But taxpayer never made an offer for the hotel's purchase and never tried to form the syndicate.</div>\n\n<div>A taxicab driver didn't engage in photography to make a profit where he was in the promotional stage of his career. He sought to create goodwill and position himself for the future by not charging for his services. Moreover, he didn't sell his photographs and ceased advertising. </div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer who built a prototype of a proposed new type of fuel efficient vehicle wasn't engaged in an activity for profit, where he didn't produce design plans or a production mold, take out any patents, consult any experts on automobile design, manufacturing or marketing, or engage in more than minimal marketing efforts. </div>",

        "text": "<div>Losses in initial or start-up stages do not indicate the activity is not for profit under the hobby loss rules ( ¶  M-5801 ). The significance of losses during the start-up phase of a business should be viewed in the context of the nature of the activity. Thus, a history of losses in research, inventing, or art, which often generate profits only after years of diligent effort, should be given less weight than in other areas. Nevertheless, taxpayers must have a bona fide (even if unreasonable) goal to realize a profit on the entire activity. This presupposes not only future net earnings, but sufficient net earnings to recoup losses that have been sustained in earlier years. For discussion of initial losses in specific activities, see ¶  M-5871 et seq.</div>\n\n<div>An attorney's losses in excess of $42,000 during the first two years that she operated her legal practice as a sole practitioner did not indicate a lack of profit objective, since it is not uncommon for new attorneys beginning a law practice to have a “difficult time for a number of years.” The attorney gave much consideration as to how to run a profitable law office before she began her practice, and she operated the practice with the intention of generating a profit. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's losses from his professional golfing activities did not negate a profit motive, since he had not been playing golf as a professional for an unduly long time when the losses were sustained. Although he had increasing costs over the years, his winnings also steadily increased each year. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer (an attorney) had losses in the fourth, fifth and sixth year of her documentary filmmaking activity, during which she completed her film. The Tax Court concluded that those years were part of the start-up phase, because taxpayer needed to finish the film before she could sell it. This period was not unreasonably long, since the start-up phase in the arts may be longer.</div>\n\n<div>Efforts to make a profit by reducing expenses helped to convince the Tax Court that a taxpayer had a profit objective. As his proficiency in the endeavor increased, he was able to reduce costs. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers argued unsuccessfully that their nearly 20 years of losses in cattle-raising and deer-herding activities were “start-up” losses that didn't negate their profit motive. The Tax Court found that the period of losses exceeded the length of time that could be called a “start-up” period. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers, husband and wife, argued that '95 should have been treated as the startup year for their farm and horse-breeding activities, because that was the year taxpayer-wife began to work full-time on the farm, to supervise employees more closely, to organize activities better, and to repair and expand the barn to accommodate more broodmares. The Tax Court rejected this argument, however, because taxpayers had bought the farm in '79, had begun their horse-breeding activities in '79, and did not show that there was any significant increase in the amount of time they actually spent on the farm and breeding activities in '95 as opposed to earlier years, nor that there was any significant change in the character of those activities. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer argued that net losses in the fourth and fifth years of her activity as a travel writer—the tax years at issue—were startup losses that didn't negate her profit motive. However, the court noted that, through the end of the sixth year of the activity, it had not shown a profit in any year, and had generated total net losses of nearly $64,000. The court found that taxpayer had failed to demonstrate that enough profits would be earned from the activity to cover those losses. </div>\n\n<div class='match' >The Tax Court concluded that taxpayers did not have a profit motive for the year at issue where they were merely in the preparatory stages of the activity but had not developed any plan by which substantial losses attributed to the activity could be offset by eventual profits. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' health club (an S corporation) was not operated with a profit motive where the substantial operating losses it incurred during each of the first five years of its operation were attributed to the manner in which the health club was operated rather than to nonrecurring start-up costs. After the fifth year of losses, the club imposed membership fees upon the taxpayers (the S corporation's shareholders) for the first time, and as a result earned a small profit in that year. The Tax Court held that the income from the taxpayers' membership fees was not evidence of a profit motive, in light of the club's history of losses. </div>",

        "text": "<div>Taxpayers may deduct ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during a tax year in carrying on a trade or business, see ¶  L-1000 et seq. But expenses paid or incurred in an activity not engaged in for profit are deductible only to the extent of income from the activity ( ¶  M-5800 et seq.). Where a taxpayer has other reasons for engaging in the activity other than profit—such as deriving personal pleasure from the activity—these reasons may cast doubt on whether the taxpayer has the requisite profit motive for deducting losses from the activity.</div>\n\n<div>But an activity won't be treated as not engaged in for profit just because the taxpayer has motives in addition to that of making a profit. That a taxpayer enjoys the activity won't in itself cause the activity to be treated as not for profit, if other factors indicate profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>IRS examiners have been instructed to address the pleasurable and recreational aspects of the activity, taking into account that the taxpayer's “savvy representative” may have advised the taxpayer to downplay the pleasurable aspects and emphasize the hard work.</div>\n\n<div>The Sixth Circuit, reversing the Tax Court, held that the Tax Court erred by focusing on the relatively minor potential personal benefits realized by taxpayers engaged in fish farming, Christmas tree, timber, and row crop undertakings on the same land as their home. The taxpayer's hunting of deer on his property for the purpose of protecting his agrarian investment, and the related placement of salt licks and feed boxes, didn't reduce the taxpayers' farm to a mere recreational hunting ground or private wild game reserve. The introduction of feed boxes to attract waterfowl or other wildlife, and the presence of ornamental plants, near the fish ponds, didn't conflict with those ponds' primary or dominant function of producing eatable fish for commercial distribution. The occasional removal of some fish by members of the taxpayers' family for personal consumption didn't make the fish ponds a mere personal hobby. Similarly, while the paved roadway installed between the taxpayers' home and their tilled acreage may have enhanced their opportunities for the personal enjoyment of their residential yard, it didn't alter that driveway's primary or dominant purpose to provide access to the crop fields for economic purposes. In the same way, the taxpayers' fence and barn had a primary or dominant economic purpose.</div>\n\n<div>The small element of personal pleasure that taxpayer derived from his mining activity, in that he enjoyed being outdoors and was tired of his earlier medical practice, didn't outweigh the hardships and danger of the activity or the depletion of taxpayer's other income and assets. The court took note that mining is a laborious activity that entails many health risks.</div>\n\n<div>Although taxpayer, a former championship boxer, bought a farm in part so his mother and other members of his family might become more prosperous by farming a larger and better piece of property, this didn't negate his profit motive. The Tax Court said that profit motive isn't undermined simply because a taxpayer derives a sense of satisfaction in providing for relatives, friends, or loved ones.</div>\n\n<div>While a person's activity as an artist involves recreational and personal elements, it can also be for profit where the person can show that he didn't stop at the creative stage but went into the marketing phase by running an art gallery and shows, etc.</div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer's support of his son's racing activity was found to have a profit objective where the son participated in races with large purses. The taxpayer conducted the activity in a business-like manner by investigating the racing business before starting out, consulting with experts and his accountant, and maintaining separate accounts and records for the activity. Further, he tried diligently to get a sponsor for his son. The losses sustained during the start-up period weren't beyond the period customary to achieving profitable status.</div>\n\n<div>Although taxpayer acknowledged that she enjoyed her show horse activity, she rarely rode any of her horses for pleasure and didn't allow her children to do so. Before engaging in the activity, she never owned a horse. There was no evidence that she had ever shown or trained horses as a hobby. The fact that she may have derived personal pleasure from watching her horses perform wasn't sufficient to cause the activity to be classified as not engaged in for profit where the activity was conducted in a business-like manner and with a profit objective.</div>\n\n<div>The Tax Court found that taxpayer had a profit motive for entering into an airplane leasing venture, despite IRS's claim that he purchased the airplane for personal use. The airplane in question was noisy, fuel-inefficient, difficult to fly, and best suited for cargo. In addition, taxpayer owned another airplane better suited for personal flying.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >A farm was still an activity engaged in for profit where the taxpayer's family consumed less than 10% of total produce, and taxpayer changed crops several times in an attempt to make operations profitable.</div>\n\n<div>The availability of other investments that would yield a higher return or are more likely to be profitable isn't evidence that an activity isn't engaged in for profit.</div>\n\n<div>But where the taxpayer was engaged in horse operations both as an individual and through a partnership, the individual expenses weren't deductible because these operations weren't for profit, even though the partnership business concededly had a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers, a married couple who had full-time jobs as salespersons, operated a business that sold parasailing rides, watersled rides, and related equipment during one summertime on weekdays and holidays. Although they loved water sport and purchased the two boats used in parasailing before they began the business, the Tax Court found a profit motive because taxpayers operated the activity in a businesslike manner. The business was operated only on days when there was a demand for the product and services. They consulted knowledgeable persons before and during the business operations, and promoted the business through printed business cards, ads in the yellow pages, and display advertising. They inquired about legal requirements and applied for an operating license which they thought was necessary. They used written contracts to protect themselves from liability and maintained an accounting system to record business receipts and disbursements.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's pecan farming activity was engaged in for profit despite the personal pleasure that the taxpayer derived from farming land that was given to him by his father. The taxpayer was a dentist who didn't engage in recreational or sporting activities on the farm, but instead devoted much of what would otherwise have been his “leisure” time away from his dental practice to performing the demanding physical labor necessary to maintain a pecan farm.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer, a solar heater salesman, installed a heater in his home for demonstration purposes. He also ate many business meals and took at least one business trip. The Tax Court held that these benefits weren't a major motive for taxpayer's sales activities, which were engaged in for profit.</div>\n\n<div>Horse racing may be a “fun” business, but that didn't mean the taxpayer engaged in that activity as a hobby rather than a business, as a taxpayer's success in a business is often related to his enjoyment of the business. The taxpayer was involved with professional horse racing associations, but that involvement was no more a “social” activity than serving on a corporate board would have been.</div>",

        "text": "<div>For purposes of the “hobby loss rule,” which disallows deductions attributable to activities not engaged in for profit except as specifically provided under the Code, whether an activity is a hobby or is engaged in for profit is determined by taking into account certain objective factors, see ¶  M-5800 et seq.</div>\n\n<div>Owning a farm and engaging in farm-related activities, such as horse-breeding, raising show horses, etc., aren't activities engaged in for profit where: (1) there's no evidence of business-like conduct of the operation; (2) there's a long history of losses for the farm or farm-related activity; (3) the farm is the taxpayer's residence; and (4) there's significant recreational use of the location.</div>\n\n<div>The Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded a Tax Court decision that disallowed taxpayers' deductions based on the Tax Court's finding that taxpayers' dominant motive with respect to their horse breeding activity was to produce tax savings rather than to make a profit. The Ninth Circuit will uphold the Tax Court's finding of a dominant non-profit motive only if the record reflects that the motive imputed by the Tax Court makes sense. To support a finding of such a dominant motive, the record must reflect that the tax savings the taxpayers expected to gain as a result of their horse breeding activity could be greater than the real economic losses the taxpayers might reasonably have expected to incur. So, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the Tax Court for a determination whether taxpayers' horse breeding activity realistically could have been expected to result in tax savings greater than the economic losses that might reasonably have been anticipated. Factors considered by the Tax Court in making its determination of a non-profit tax savings motive included the fact that taxpayers had minimal experience and training in horse breeding and incurred excessive monthly rental payments. </div>\n\n<div>In the following situations, horse operations weren't engaged in for profit: <ul> <li> Taxpayer, a full-time sales representative, failed to devise or follow an operating plan for his Arabian horse breeding activity. It was unclear whether taxpayer intended to create a breeding herd or show horses, or to train or teach in the field. </li> <li> The only activities of taxpayer's ranch during the years at issue were the feeding, care, and training of one to three horses and the training of taxpayer's children to enter 4-H horse shows. The 4-H program rules prohibited the parent from being in the business of raising, showing, breeding, or training horses for third persons for compensation. When the taxpayer's children became too old to participate in 4-H activities, the ranching ended. </li> <li> Taxpayers' only daughter excelled at riding horses, and their horse breeding activity didn't make a profit in any of its nine years of operation. Taxpayers didn't change their methods of operation to try to make the enterprise profitable. </li> <li> Taxpayer claimed substantial losses over a ten-year period from a wholly-owned S corporation engaged in farming. Amounts spent for breeding animals were small compared to the amounts spent for driveways and landscaping. The taxpayer's personal use of the horses appeared to override any decision to engage in a horse-breeding activity. </li> <li> Taxpayer couldn't make a profit from breeding Arabian horses because she reduced her holdings of productive mares, she had little expertise in breeding, didn't use records to improve operations, did little advertising, and her husband had a large income against which she could offset losses. </li> <li> Taxpayer testified that she raised horses for profit, not for fun, that she advertised her horses for sale in magazines and horse related publications and that she had sold seven horses for an average price of $2,000. The activity wasn't conducted in a business-like manner. No evidence was presented of when the horses were bought and sold nor of the timing and amount of expenses for feed and other items needed for horse breeding. </li> <li> Taxpayer attempted to establish an endurance horse breeding and training facility. After five years, neither of his two mares had been bred, and the operation earned no income. Taxpayer earned a substantial income working full-time in the insurance business. His spare time was divided between his endurance horse activities and his involvement with vintage automobiles. The court found that taxpayer's personal enjoyment was the motivation for his attempts to establish the horse ranch. </li> <li> Taxpayer sustained annual losses in his horse breeding and racing activity for 20 years without attempting to increase profitability. He failed to introduce cost-cutting measures or change the manner of conducting the activity in response to years of mounting losses. </li> <li> Taxpayers engaged in paso fino horse breeding activity for 11 years without ever coming close to making a profit. Taxpayers' books and records (which didn't include any financial statements, profit and loss projections, budgets, breakeven analyses, or marketing surveys) weren't used to implement cost-saving measures or to improve profitability, but only to substantiate expenses claimed on their returns. While in theory taxpayers could have turned a profit had they hit the lottery with a million-dollar horse, the taxpayers' prospect for doing so with their existing horses was negligible. </li> <li> Taxpayer, an airline pilot, could afford to operate his horse breeding activity as a hobby. Although he had been involved with horses since childhood, studied breeding operations and bloodlines, read books and journals on the subject matter, and took a short university course on equine reproduction, he never consulted any horse breeders about the best way to minimize expenses or to operate a profitable business, and started the activity with no concept of what his ultimate costs might be or how he might achieve any degree of cost efficiency. In an 11-year period, he incurred net losses of from $92,210 to $154,365. Moreover, he didn't keep adequate records, commingled the financial affairs of the horse breeding activity with his personal finances, didn't make any written forecasts or projections of future income and failed to formulate a credible business or profit plan. He spent a significant amount of time on the activity, but that was due to his fondness for horses rather than an expectation of profit. </li> <li> Taxpayer, a plastic surgeon who was heavily involved in polo and equestrian activities, had losses operating a horse ranch for several years and had no realistic possibility of making a profit. </li> <li> Taxpayer sustained increasing losses over a six-year period from his Percheron draft horse breeding activity, but made no attempt to change his operation. He kept no income statements and no profit or business plans. Although he lacked expertise in the breeding and raising of Percheron horses, he didn't study the profit potential of raising them, seek out competent and experienced partners, nor consult books or persons operating profitable businesses in the breeding of Percheron horses. There was no established market for the horses, and prices received on their sale were low compared to the costs of producing them. </li> <li> Taxpayers engaged in horse racing and breeding activities for at least 16 years, losing more than $465,000 without coming near a profit. They initiated their activity without developing a business plan, and throughout those years of continuous losses didn't materially alter their mode of operation. While they didn't ride their horses or make them available for others to ride, they did attend races at the track, watch their horses race, and gamble on the races. The enjoyment taxpayers got from being engaged in horse racing and breeding was the most significant reason they continued to engage in the activity despite their record of consistent losses. </li> <li> Taxpayer, a doctor, failed to show that breeding, training and showing his Arabian horses had the primary objective of making a profit. He had a long and consistent history of losses (1986 through 1997) that wasn't due to either a depressed market or the death or infertility of several horses. Expenditures he made during a period of market decline (refurbishing his house, building a lake, garage, exercise facility, barn stalls, and run-in sheds) were inconsistent with his assertion that circumstances beyond his control contributed to his losses. Nor could the losses, as the taxpayer argued, be attributed to the startup phase of his horse-breeding activity (i.e., the first 5 to 10 years) because the taxpayer had been breeding Arabian horses since 1976. The taxpayer didn't conduct this activity in a businesslike manner. He never developed a business plan or detailed break-even analysis, and never consulted with experts on the financial aspects of his horse activities. While he maintained separate checking accounts for his personal and horse-related activities, he would on occasion ignore this division. In addition, he paid his friend who lived with him 40% to 50% commissions on horse sales, when the normal rate was 10% to 15%. </li> <li> Taxpayer, a successful full-time dentist, didn't engage in an activity of breeding and showing Arabian horses for profit. Over a 16-year period, she never owned more than eight horses, of which five were produced by her breeding activities. She sold only one horse during that period, and retained all her other horses regardless of the ability to breed or their desirability as breeding stock. Moreover, that single sale produced her only profitable year, and the profit for that year was only $209. Other factors that showed that she didn't conduct the activity for profit were her failure to conduct the activity in a businesslike manner, including her failure to undertake any actions to improve its profitability, the lack of expertise of both taxpayer and her advisors in the business of horse breeding, her substantial income from her dental practice, and the fact that she rode her horses for pleasure. </li> <li> Taxpayer, the sole shareholder of a corporation engaged in horse rental, breeding, showing and riding lessons, operated this activity in an unbusinesslike manner. While the horse activity had the “trappings” of business carried on for profit (e.g., books and records kept by a certified public accountant (CPA), a separate bank account, advertising, and significant time and effort expended by the taxpayer), the taxpayer didn't use his records to improve operations, and, despite mounting losses, failed to make changes to increase profits. Although the taxpayer was knowledgeable about horses, he lacked the business expertise to make the farm profitable and failed to seek professional advice. Losses as a result of several horse injuries and the expected work for the horses in a television show never materializing weren't beyond the taxpayer's control where the taxpayer didn't show that the horse activity would have been profitable had the horses not suffered these injuries, and the taxpayer didn't actively seek any other television or film work. In addition, substantial income from regular employment allowed the taxpayer to continue operating the horse activity despite heavy losses. </li> <li> Taxpayer acquired horses for his daughter's riding pleasure. Taxpayer remained fully occupied with his dental practice and made no effort to be involved in horse show activities. </li> <li> Taxpayers' focus of their horse breeding and training activity was to “nurture” their son's goal of becoming a world-class rider. Taxpayers stated that their son's goal could only be achieved by hiring and consulting with experts in the horse field. Taxpayers took pleasure from the activity, both from watching their son develop into a horseman and from the reputation they hoped to acquire in the community as a result of their association with the horses, riders, and trainers. </li> <li> Taxpayer offered little evidence that his horse breeding and racing activity was engaged in for any reason other than as an outlet for his love of horses. During the four tax years in issue, taxpayer didn't try to improve profitability by devising new methods of operations. Taxpayer was granted a horse racing license by the states of California and Arizona, but such a license was necessary whether the horse racing activity was conducted as a hobby or as a business. </li> <li> Taxpayer, although dedicated to her horse breeding activity, was primarily motivated by her love of horses, which dated back to her childhood. Taxpayer had no training or experience in the horse breeding/training business, made no studies or consultations with professionals about the activity's business aspects, didn't maintain a separate bank account or formal books and records, and didn't make any effort to change the direction of her operation (which incurred eight years of losses), although she recognized her need to do so. </li> <li> Taxpayer testified that he had enjoyed working with horses since his childhood, and also admitted that his children sometimes rode the horses used in his horse breeding and training activity. Taxpayer failed to produce adequate business records to corroborate his claims about the time that he spent in the activity, the number of his customers, or the presence of a business plan. </li> <li> Taxpayers, husband and wife, operated a horse farm for pleasure. The wife, an accomplished rider, performed at shows and was responsible for most of the farm activities, while her husband earned substantial income as a medical doctor. </li> <li> Taxpayer-wife's recreational objectives in breeding and showing “cutting horses” were a significant component of the taxpayers' horse-related activity, which generated substantial losses (averaging $40,000 a year for the last seven years) for 23 of the 26 years of the activity. She had actively pursued an interest in horses since the age of 14, riding in competitions in high school and college. Taxpayer-husband had substantial annual income (over $90,000 in each of the last seven years) and deduction of the losses significantly reduced the after-tax cost of his wife's activity. Additional evidence of the personal component to the activity was taxpayer's purchase of the horse his wife had ridden in high school, and an essentially noneconomic transaction in which they bought and sold back a horse for a nominal price to provide the wife with a mount to ride in nonprofessional cutting horse competitions while their prize stallion was being ridden in professional competition by a trainer. </li> <li> Taxpayers, husband and wife who engaged in Arabian horse racing, breeding, and sales, operated these activities in a nonbusinesslike manner, and derived personal pleasure from their work with horses. Factors indicating their lack of profit motive included: their lack of expertise, their history of significant losses, their failure to take actions to make their activity profitable, their ability to use the activity's losses to avoid paying income and self-employment taxes in four of the five years in issue, and the unlikelihood of asset appreciation. </li> <li> Taxpayer raised only one horse during the three years in issue, and that horse never produced any revenue. The horse was unable to race because it injured its leg and, although the horse went on to win about 20 ribbons in hunter/jumper shows, it never won any money. The taxpayer couldn't show any profit objective in raising and training the horse for resale. Because the horse had been neutered, its resale value was limited. Taxpayer's five-year plan showed an overall loss. </li> <li> Taxpayer (1) was involved with horses her whole life, expressed pride in the trophies won by her horses and referred to her horses as “her babies,” (2) kept no formal accounting records and commingled those records that she did keep with her personal records, (3) didn't maintain a separate bank account for the horse activity, (4) sustained substantial, consistent and generally increasing losses for the entire ten-year period during which she engaged in the activity, and (5) financed her horse activities with substantial income that she had from unrelated passive sources. </li> <li> Taxpayer, a self-employed chiropractor, incurred $388,106 in losses from his Arabian horse-breeding activity during a seven-year period. Even though he managed to turn his chiropractic clinic into a successful operation after incurring losses during the early years of his business, the Tax Court wasn't convinced that the skills needed to run a successful clinic applied to operating a profitable horse farm. Further, taxpayer didn't operate the activity in a businesslike manner. Although he registered his horse-breeding activity and filed the appropriate employment tax returns, taxpayer didn't have an organized system for determining the profitability of each horse. Further, even though he promoted the activity through advertising and the showing of his horses, the promotion wasn't successful, and he didn't change his methods to attempt to improve his success rate. Moreover, there were no income records, and the only expense records offered into evidence were canceled checks. </li> <li> Taxpayers began their horse-breeding operations with no expertise in running a profitable ranch, nor any detailed written plan fashioned to enable them to earn a profit. The operations produced only ever-increasing expenses and losses; the few actual sales they made gave no promise of recouping the considerable losses they incurred. Indeed, selling their entire stock for its fair market value wouldn't have compensated them for those losses. Moreover, taxpayers' testimony about actions to reduce their losses and increase their income from the horse-breeding operations was vague and self-serving. Finally, taxpayers' income from other sources was adequate to support a comfortable standard of living even after taking into account the money spent on the horse-breeding operations, and their interest in horse-breeding was prompted by their daughter's love for horses. These factors outweighed the businesslike character of their books and records, and the hard, often unpleasant, work that taxpayers performed in connection with the operation. </li> <li> Taxpayer (1) incurred seven consecutive years of losses in horse breeding and equestrian training activity, (2) didn't keep a separate bank account for the activity, (3) kept invoices, checks and receipts, but no other records of the activity, (4) had some knowledge of training a horse for dressage and low-level jumping but had no formal training in horse training or breeding, (5) took no steps to increase his knowledge or to consult experts during the years at issue, (6) bought a gelding and bred another horse knowing that any male offspring would probably have to be gelded (so risking having horses with no breeding or performing value should they suffer training injuries), (7) bought a horse without knowing that it wasn't suitable for performing, (8) had taxable income from other sources during the years at issue sufficient to maintain a comfortable standard of living notwithstanding the horse activity losses, (9) engaged in horse exercise, riding and maintenance for 15 to 18 hours a week, but not significant actual horse training and (10) devoted an average of 58 hours a week to his professional practice as a psychologist. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the Tax Court's conclusion that the taxpayer's horse training and breeding activity wasn't engaged in for profit, but noted that it was a “close question” and based its affirmance on the clearly-erroneous standard (which applies to a circuit court's ability to substitute its factual findings for the factual findings of the Tax Court, see ¶  U-5104 .) </li> <li> Taxpayer, a successful attorney who operated a horse farm, kept no records showing the expenditures made with respect to each individual horse. Without that knowledge, he had no way of knowing which of his broodmares was producing more profitable foals or which training regimen was successful at increasing the value of the horses. Nor did he separate the expenses incurred from his horse-breeding activity from the expenses incurred from raising steers. Although taxpayer and his family spent significant amounts of time and effort carrying on the horse-breeding activity, taxpayer and his daughter were avid riders and derived substantial recreational benefit from the time they spent with the horses. </li> <li> Taxpayers, husband and wife, failed to establish that they had a business plan for generating a profit from roping horse activity; hadn't consulted with professionals as to how to make the activity profitable; and failed to show that they changed operation of the roping horse activity to generate a profit or that they hired any individual with the expertise and experience necessary to make that activity profitable. In addition, the deductions attributable to the roping horse activity far exceeded the income that was derived from that activity, and the nature of the tasks and amount of time that the husband spent in the roping horse activity was consistent with his lifetime enjoyment of horses. </li> <li> Taxpayers didn't prepare a business plan, didn't refer to their horse-related financial records to monitor expenses, had no separate bank account for the horse-related activities, didn't show an expectation that their horses would appreciate in value, had never had a profitable year with their horse-related activities, derived tax benefits from their claimed losses due to income from other sources, and enjoyed horses. The Tax Court cited the taxpayers' long history of working with horses in determining that there was an element of personal pleasure in their horse-related activities inconsistent with a profit motive. The taxpayers had excellent credentials for horse breeding, training, and racing, but it wasn't clear whether they had experience or sought advice with respect to the financial aspects of operating a horse business. </li> <li> Taxpayer sustained losses on his horse breeding and racing activities for 37 straight years and didn't change his manner of conducting the activity to improve profitability. Although the taxpayer took steps to increase his expertise on horses, and used professional trainers to raise his horses, he did nothing to increase his knowledge of successful business and economic practices with respect to breeding and racing horses and didn't seek advice on the economic aspects of his horse-related activities. The taxpayer had a separate bank account and kept detailed financial breeding records, but didn't have budgets, income statements, balance sheets, income projections, or financial statements for the activity (other than those compiled by his accountant to prepare tax returns). Finally, the taxpayer had substantial other income against which to offset his losses from horse-related activities. </li> <li> Taxpayers sustained losses on their horse breeding activities for the 16 years in which they were engaged in those activities, didn't have a written business plan, had no more than vague plans to make the business profitable, didn't consult with experts on how to make their operations profitable, and had substantial income from other sources against which to offset the losses from the horse breeding activities. These factors outweighed the facts that taxpayers acquired expertise in breeding and raising horses, and spent a significant amount of time and effort on the activities, and convinced the court that the activities weren't engaged in for profit. </li> <li> Taxpayer argued his profit motive from his cutting horse activity was based on the goal of having one of his horses become a triple crown winner, but the likelihood of that was small. He had no business records for the activity, spent only 8 to 10 hours a week on it, and incurred losses of $568,000 offset by only minimal gains on individual sales (under $1,000) and no profitable periods. He had substantial income from his other pursuits, but no history of success in horse-related activities, which provided recreational benefits—he conceded he derived personal enjoyment from the activity. </li> <li> Taxpayers submitted no books and records with projected profit and loss (P/L), balance sheets, or budgets. Inventory lists were incomplete and full of errors, showing horses that were no longer living or no longer owned. Taxpayers claimed they offered numerous services that a hobbyist farm wouldn't offer such as breeding services, horse sales and leasing, and riding lessons, but none of those generated any income. Taxpayers spent very little on advertising ($1,120) compared to their overall expenses of over $200,000, and didn't seek professional advice on the business aspects of running a profitable horse business. They presented evidence that they were considered “top breeders,” but this didn't show that they had business expertise. Taxpayers, who derived substantial personal pleasure from the activities, never showed a profit in 20 years, while their income from other sources ranged from $1 million to $2.5 million during the years at issue. </li> <li> Taxpayer's equine-related activities lacked a profit motive in 2009. She owned no horse in 2009 and in the preceding 10 years only one which she unsuccessfully tried to breed, and she competed in no horse shows. Her receipts from the activities from 2004–2009 were $588, compared to expenses of $155,244. </li> <li> Taxpayers' horse farm lost money every year but one of the 16 years in the court record. Losses were approximately $130,000 to $170,000 a year, and the farm made only $1,500 in the profitable year. Taxpayers didn't keep adequate records (see ¶  M-5834 ), didn't reform a contract with its sole employee that all but ensured they wouldn't make a reasonable profit (see ¶  M-5850 ), and didn't employ an expert in the horse-breeding business (see ¶  M-5855 ). The relatively large size of the horse farm (30 horses) wasn't dispositive that the activity was a trade or business. </li> </ul> </div>\n\n<div class='match' >In the following situations, horse operations were engaged in for profit: <ul> <li> A taxpayer was able to demonstrate that personal pleasure and recreation in operating a Morgan horse farm wasn't a significant motive where (1) he didn't live at the farm for the first ten years of its operation, (2) there were no recreational facilities there, (3) a back injury prevented him from riding horses, and (4) his wife and children rode horses infrequently. </li> <li> Taxpayers' participation in horse breeding activities wasn't driven by pleasure alone and had a profit motive where taxpayers: (1) spent six or seven years learning about horse breeding and management before attempting to engage in the activity; (2) developed a comprehensive written business plan; (3) managed and worked diligently and daily on the horse activity; (4) consulted expert horsemen and hired expert horse trainers; (5) made adjustments in their business plan; (6) maintained reasonably good books and records of income and expenses relating to the activity; and (7) after nine years, terminated their unprofitable horse activity in light of the losses realized. </li> <li> A successful businessman who began his Arabian horse breeding activity as a means of generating income for his retirement proved his profit objective where he kept complete and accurate records, advertised extensively, prepared a promotional video, exhibited the horses at shows, consulted experts, did the grooming, worming, vaccinating and other day-to-day tasks, and ran the operation in a conservative manner that emphasized minimizing expenses. </li> <li> A dentist, who began his Arabian horse breeding activity to provide a retirement plan, carried on this activity in a businesslike manner: he kept books and records (including a general ledger and separate bank account for this activity, and breeding, pedigree and health records) and had a business plan (which he modified in order to reduce expenses and increase profits). He consulted with other horse breeders and educated himself about horse breeding, equine health care, and farm management. He attended horse shows to learn about this business, hired professional trainers, and advertised his horses for sale. The taxpayer spent substantial time and effort in the horse breeding activity and derived little personal pleasure from the activity. Losses sustained by the taxpayer were during the startup phase of the activity and were the result of unforeseen circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control (a decline in the horse market and the death of several horses). </li> <li> Taxpayers bought four Appaloosa horses for pleasure, and the next year they decided to go into the horse business and other related farm activities. They performed substantially all of the labor, each working at least 40 hours per week in farming activities. The taxpayers stopped turkey and geese breeding operations when these activities failed to make a profit. They kept accurate records, worked to develop expertise in the field, and consulted experts. Moreover, the taxpayers' income from other sources, when compared with losses generated from the farm, was modest. The court concluded that the activity wasn't conducted for personal pleasure or recreation because none of the horses were used for recreational riding, and the farm required a great deal of hard work. </li> <li> Taxpayers used experienced advisors before investing in breeding horses and before making critical decisions and hired qualified persons to oversee the day-to-day operations. There didn't appear to be a personal or recreational element in the taxpayers' activities because they didn't ride horses. Although their daughters did ride, the taxpayers kept separate horses for their use. The segregation of business and personal aspects was also shown in the taxpayers' recordkeeping, e.g., they paid boarding fees for their breeding horses and their “pleasure” horses with separate checks. </li> <li> Taxpayers engaged in the training and breeding of paint horses for profit where: taxpayers kept business-like records, taxpayers had earlier engaged in and given up the training and breeding of Arabian horses because it was unprofitable; taxpayers consulted with experts in setting up the activity, and hired experts to conduct the actual training and breeding activities; taxpayers had only a modest income from other sources; taxpayers honestly and actually believed that success in the activity would produce substantial earnings and profits, and an expert confirmed that one of their three horses had real potential for success; taxpayers and their family didn't ride the horses for pleasure. </li> <li> Taxpayers operated their horse breeding and boarding activity in a serious, organized, and business-like manner. Though IRS contended that their records were inadequate because they weren't kept for each horse, the taxpayers could generate complete and accurate records and reports on individual horses from their personal computer. The taxpayers had a business plan and pursued it consistently, even if the plan wasn't written. They improved and expanded their facilities and boarded horses while beginning to acquire quality broodmares. And while they paid most of the expenses for their horse activity with personal funds, it was reasonable for a new activity, with very little cash flow, to do so. Further, losses due to the death of a mare and foal (a 25% loss in the taxpayers' breeding capability) was an unforeseen circumstances beyond the taxpayers' control that didn't show that the horse activity wasn't engaged in for profit. </li> <li> Taxpayer engaged in horse breeding and racing for profit where he: didn't receive any pleasure from racing and breeding horses; consulted and relied on experts; and changed his business plan by shifting a prospective race horse to use in breeding when it became injured. </li> <li> An orthodontist who started a horse breeding farm in preparation for his retirement from dental practice conducted the activity in a business-like manner. He consulted with professionals in the field before starting-up, bought a ranch away from his own home, built proper facilities, spent 35 to 40 hours per week on these activities, and kept complete and accurate records. Although he had operating losses, these were offset, at least in part, by unrealized increases in the value of the ranch and the horses on the ranch. The taxpayer didn't engage in these activities for personal pleasure because he and his wife had no affection for horses. Their activities (including attending horse shows) were only for business, not social purposes. The court concluded that the taxpayer wouldn't likely embark on a hobby costing thousands of dollars and much personal physical labor without a profit motive. </li> <li> Taxpayer engaged in horse breeding and racing for ten years. None of the 40 horses owned were ever bred or used for pleasure riding. The Tax Court found it unlikely that a person would expend substantial amounts of funds to buy and breed so many horses for a hobby or tax benefit in which no pleasure was derived. Also, if the horse operation didn't have a profit objective, the taxpayer wouldn't have abandoned it. </li> <li> Taxpayer operated a steeplechase training and racing stable that primarily made money by racing its horses to win purses. The taxpayer carried on her steeplechase activity in a businesslike manner, maintained complete and accurate books and records, had expertise in steeplechase training and racing, employed competent help and engaged expert consultants. The taxpayer personally performed time-consuming, physically exhausting, and dirty manual and menial labor at the stables, including shoveling horse manure, in an effort to reduce costs. While the taxpayer may have grown up training and racing horses, enjoyed steeplechase training, and loved to ride, she did no steeplechase racing in this country and employed professional jockeys to ride the stable's horses in all races. </li> <li> Taxpayer, although fully employed elsewhere, operated a horse breeding operation for profit where she (1) conducted the operation in a businesslike manner (as evidenced by detailed financial records, a separate bank account, and a business plan, which was modified as needed); (2) increased her expertise in pedigrees and bloodlines by consulting with experts and reading an industry journal, and demonstrated that expertise by serving as a judge at horse shows; (3) spent significant time and effort on the horse breeding activities; and (4) didn't ride the horses she bred. These factors outweighed the fact that the taxpayer's breeding activities had never had a profitable year. The Tax Court also held that the taxpayer had profitably engaged in similar activities in the past, based on the taxpayer's successful operation of a medical billing service. </li> <li> Taxpayers operated a horse training and breeding business for profit even though they had losses in their first eight years. They demonstrated a profit motive by advertising, promotions, professional trainers, maintaining insurance, keeping records, abandoning unprofitable methods, and the amount of time they devoted to the horses in addition to maintaining unrelated full time positions. The taxpayers also demonstrated that the activity could recoup early losses through future earnings and appreciation, and that taxpayer husband's successfully started two unrelated business ventures and made them profitable. They refrained from riding the horses for pleasure and traveling with them to all activity related events. </li> <li> Despite an earlier determination (by the same judge) that taxpayer didn't have a profit motive (footnote 61, above), the Tax Court found taxpayer's continued and modified operations demonstrated the requisite profit motive. The taxpayer had extensive personal expertise, expended significant time on the activity, had a reasonable expectation that the assets would appreciate in value, and had success in other breeding activities. Though he still didn't show a profit, taxpayer, after studying new methods and consulting experts, demonstrated a profit motive by doubling his breeding program through a change from live cover to artificial insemination (which allowed his stallions to breed with more mares and maximized fertilization opportunities, ultimately producing more horses to sell and/or breed). He also worked with veterinarians while they performed the procedure, purchased artificial insemination equipment, and hired a veterinarian to work at his ranch. Taxpayer maintained breeding records, foaling records, records of purchases, sales, deaths and maintenance of his horses, and a database of his mares' breeding habits on a computer. In addition, the taxpayer used industry standard forms and contracts, and registered his breeding activity. </li> <li> Taxpayers' horse boarding activity was conducted for profit. They had the necessary expertise and experience, maintained business-like records, conducted a word-of-mouth campaign to attract customers, and were generally able to rent out more than half of their available stalls. Their losses were largely due to vagaries in the price of hay, and taxpayers took steps to control these costs. Moreover, in connection with the activity, taxpayers expended significant time (including significant travel time between their home and their stables) and significant physical effort, and made out-of-pocket expenditures that were a rather large part of their total income—34% and 46%—for the two tax years in question. </li> <li> Taxpayers' horse breeding activity was conducted for profit. They had significant experience training horses, consulted with appropriate experts, conducted the activity in a businesslike manner, advertised in trade magazines, and attended seminars. In addition, they kept records, and made changes in their methods, in a manner consistent with an intent to improve profitability. They devoted considerable time to, and handled all material aspects of, the activity. They didn't have substantial income or capital from other sources, and devoted all of their savings from their only wage-earning activities to the horse breeding activity. </li> <li> A taxpayer's horse breeding activity was engaged in for profit. He kept better records for that activity than for his wife's cosmetology business, which IRS had agreed was entered into for profit. He had no other job, so he could devote full time to the undertaking. He had consulted experts, and had an informal business plan. One factor in the taxpayer's favor was his attempt to save money and adopt different strategies as he attempted unsuccessfully to make his business profitable. He learned how to take care of the horses himself to save on veterinarian bills, and undertook, when there was a drought that drove up feed prices, to grow his own feed. The taxpayer's personal motives didn't underlie his choice of activities. He seldom rode the horses, and the work he undertook, rising early to feed the horses, cleaning the barns, and staying up all night with sick or pregnant horses, could hardly be described as pleasurable. Although he lost a lot of money, the losses were mostly a result of circumstances beyond his control, and there was considerable evidence that he had attempted to make a profit. </li> <li> Taxpayers had a profit motive for their horse-breeding activities despite running losses for ten years (over $400,000 in total), including all of the years at issue. The court noted no motive other than profit could explain “their willingness to persist in an activity that had become so frustrating and unpleasant.” Although their intent to turn a profit was “objectively” unreasonable, it was their genuine subjective intent. Taxpayers' record-keeping involved a shoebox, but it was adequate for their purposes. They weren't wealthy business people dabbling in horses in their spare time: the wife worked with the horses full time; and the husband devoted all of his nonworking hours to them. And the time spent wasn't in riding horses or attending horse shows, but in grueling, strenuous labor. They had a rudimentary business plan: to weather the loss years and maintain a herd of at least 40 to retain zoning status as an equestrian center. They spent nine years and a substantial amount of funds to clear title to one horse, a purebred Arabian stallion, solely in an attempt to generate profit. Taxpayers' middle class status meant they couldn't afford to maintain the horse activity simply for pleasure if they had no hope of future profits. </li> <li> Taxpayers generally conducted their horse breeding in a businesslike manner, they adapted their plan over time to take into account changing circumstances, and identified potential sources of significant future revenue. The taxpayers showed extensive expertise in the area, spent substantial amounts of time devoted to the operation, and offered well-reasoned justifications for decisions to heal one horse that had prospects, while putting down another horse where they determined the cost to heal her exceeded her projected selling price. These positives offset their sloppy recordkeeping and limited advertising. </li> <li> After success as a nightclub owner, taxpayer acquired property on which horses were boarded and held it for two years primarily motivated by the hope it would appreciate. He then relocated, built a premier training facility, hired experts, became knowledgeable about racing strategies, and devoted substantial time to horse-related activities. He was asked by peers to run for leadership positions in professional horse racing organizations, and lobbied for horse racing interests. His record-keeping system was rudimentary, but sufficient for making informed business decisions. Taxpayer suffered losses (some of which were due to unfortunate circumstances, such as the quarantine and death of several horses) while in the long start-up phase for horse-related activities, but his occasional successes were sufficient to support expectations of eventual profits (e.g., one of his horses was nominated to run in Triple Crown races). While taxpayer was engaged in the social and enjoyable aspects of the business in the earlier years, he thereafter shifted to the less pleasurable area of horse training. The Tax Court held taxpayer established a profit-seeking motive after relocating to the new property, so his losses were disallowed for the first two years at issue and allowed for the later years. But the Seventh Circuit held that taxpayer could deduct his losses for all years at issue, as it believed that the taxpayer's activities in the first two years were preparatory to entering the business and not simply a hobby that later grew into a business. The Seventh Circuit didn't believe that the taxpayer's involvement in horse racing associations in the first two years was merely social and enjoyable but was more in the nature of serving on a corporate board. </li> <li> In what the Tax Court termed a close case, it held taxpayer's activities of purchasing, breeding, and racing horses were profit-motivated. The key factor was taxpayer's reliance on a very successful and experienced trainer, who not only worked with taxpayer's horses but was a co-owner. Because the trainer clearly operated with a profit motive, his substantial involvement lent credence to taxpayer's motivation as well. The court conceded taxpayer took personal pleasure from the activities and had a long history of losses. But it noted that had substantial offers to buy some of his horses been accepted, profits could have been generated in several years. The court also found taxpayer operated his activities in a business-like manner, maintaining thorough and accurate records, and selling horses and otherwise adjusting his business practices in a manner consistent with profit-seeking. </li> <li> Taxpayers conducted their Arabian horse-breeding activities in a business-like manner, using a CPA for financial recordkeeping and a specialty law firm to draft contracts. They developed detailed annual business plans and engaged in extensive advertising and promotional activities. The large number of horses sold by taxpayers, though not resulting in profits most years, showed they weren't merely keeping them as pets. They didn't track their holdings on a horse-by-horse basis but kept sufficient records to make business decisions. They relocated from Florida to California in an attempt to increase profits. They worked full time on the activity, developed a high level of expertise, and relied on qualified outside experts when appropriate. They suffered losses of roughly $1 million a year for a long period (longer than the normal start-up period), but this coincided with a difficult economic climate for Arabian horses and particular problems encountered by taxpayers. And taxpayers did show a substantial profit in one year. </li> </ul> </div>\n\n<div>Numerous decisions under Code Sec. 162 , relating to deductions for a trade or business, for tax years beginning before the enactment of Code Sec. 183 in 1970 are applicable as a guide in determining whether an activity's a for-profit trade or business, because the regs under Code Sec. 183 are largely distilled from these cases.</div>\n\n<div>Many of these decisions hold that raising and maintaining horses for breeding and racing purposes is a trade or business under Code Sec. 162 and that losses incurred in connection with the activities are deductible. On the other hand, deductions were sometimes disallowed on the ground that taxpayer was carrying on a hobby rather than a business.</div>",

        "text": "<div>Under the hobby loss rules, deductions attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit are limited, see ¶  M-5800 et seq. All facts and circumstances must be taken into account in determining whether an activity's engaged in for profit, see ¶  M-5832 et seq.</div>\n\n<div>Losses that continue beyond the period usually necessary for an activity to become profitable may indicate the activity isn't engaged in for profit, particularly where taxpayer takes no steps to increase profitability and other factors indicate that the activity isn't engaged in for profit.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's cattle ranching activities weren't engaged in for profit, despite the considerable amount of time spent on the those activities, and despite the fact that taxpayer had only moderate income from other sources. Taxpayer began reporting the activity in '82, and never reported a net profit. Moreover, taxpayer presented no credible evidence that he had any real plan for reversing the continuous stream of losses from the activity.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' cattle-raising and deer-herding activities showed a profit only once in 20 years, and the record indicated that the losses from these operations would continue for the foreseeable future. These factors suggested that taxpayers didn't engage in those activities with a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers who had engaged in horse breeding activities for at least 22 years, with a net loss of at least $217,356 during a six-year period that included the years at issue, didn't have a profit motive. They didn't even come close to generating a profit from those activities during any of the years at issue. Similarly, a taxpayer whose cumulative losses from breeding, raising and racing thoroughbreds over an 18-year period exceeded $888,000 didn't engage in those activities for profit. The start-up phase of a horse breeding activity is five to 10 years, and the years in issue were well beyond that period.</div>\n\n<div>A farm, which had increasing losses despite business-like manner with which the operation was carried out, was found to be an activity not engaged in for profit. The business-like management and efforts to improve efficiency were done to diminish the losses of a hobby.</div>\n\n<div>And, the most compelling factors indicating that taxpayers didn't engage in their horse-related activities (showing and breeding “cutting horses”) with a profit objective was their history of losses—23 of 26 years, averaging $40,000 per year for the last seven years of the activity—and their failure to make any significant attempts to modify their method of operation to improve profitability, even though the losses had been continuous for the last 15 years of the activity. Similarly, the fact that the taxpayer reported a loss from her horse breeding activities for each of the 12 years she reported those activities was a significant factor in the court's refusal to find a profit motive. The taxpayer's total loss for that period was $749,338, while her total income was $60,838. While acknowledging that the start-up period for horse breeding could last up to 10 years, the Tax Court, and the Eleventh Circuit on appeal, noted that the taxpayer reported losses of over $60,000 in both the eleventh and twelfth years of her horse breeding activity.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >Where the taxpayer was bound to incur losses for several years under the terms of a lease of property he owned, there was no profit motive for the activity. This situation was different than the usual “start up” activities when early losses are expected, but where effort and imagination can make the venture profitable.</div>\n\n<div>Another taxpayer's history of losses was the most persuasive evidence that his boat charter activity wasn't engaged in for profit. Taxpayer, who enjoyed sailing for personal pleasure, bought a sailboat and enrolled it in a charter fleet on Lake Superior. The court acknowledged that the taxpayers carried on the activity in a business-like manner (see ¶  M-5834 et seq.), had the necessary personal expertise to engage in a sailboat charter business (see ¶  M-5852 et seq.), expended reasonable time and effort in carrying on the activity (see ¶  M-5860 et seq.), and had a reasonable expectation that the sailboat might appreciate in value (see ¶  M-5868 ). Nevertheless, the deductions were denied because the taxpayers received no profits from the activity and couldn't expect to receive any. The only cash flow they could expect from the activity was from tax benefits.</div>\n\n<div>Where a full-time commercial airline pilot (taxpayer) who also engaged in his own airline activities (building airplanes from kits and then selling them) consistently reported substantial net losses from those activities, the losses (ranging from $37,881 to $102,607 over an 11-year period) were “highly indicative” of a lack of profit motive. The taxpayer used those losses to offset the significant wages he earned the airline, and his taxable pension and annuity income of approximately $183,400 per year.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' history of “substantial” or “huge” losses from their horse activities—well over $300,000 per year for eight years—belied any notion that the activities were operated for profit. Any bona fide expectation of profit that taxpayers might have had at the outset no longer existed, in light of those recurring losses.</div>\n\n<div>There was no profit motive where taxpayer failed to make a profit in 15 years of part-time stock car racing, five years of drag racing, 15 years of dog breeding, 36 out of 37 years of farming, 11 years of maintenance activity, 10 years of software development activity (writing and debugging programs for an obsolete computer), or seven years of gold mining activities (not including the years spent prospecting).</div>\n\n<div>The taxpayers lacked a profit objective with respect to their horse breeding and racing activity where they claimed disproportionate loss deductions for all four tax years of the operation of the activity (the activity produced $285 in gross receipts and $35,492 in losses during the tax years at issue). Despite this financial history, taxpayer made no attempt to improve profitability by devising new methods of operations or business plans.</div>\n\n<div>Similarly, taxpayer's standardbred horse breeding and racing operation wasn't an activity engaged in for profit where there was a consistent history of losses and a lack of evidence showing that taxpayer investigated or evaluated the factors affecting the profitability of the operation, developed profit plans or break-even analyses or consulted experts on how to make the operation profitable. The taxpayer's failure to establish these facts could be explained by his lack of concern over them, because he had more than sufficient income as a doctor and consultant, especially taking account of the tax savings generated by the losses.</div>\n\n<div>That taxpayers had realized “no profits whatsoever” during more than 25 years of horse breeding, training, and racing activities was a strong indication they weren't engaged in those activities for profit. Although taxpayers argued that the losses had been caused by factors beyond their control (injury, illness, and death of a number of their horses and the failure of legislation that would have allowed video lottery terminals [slot machines] at horse racing tracks), they failed to show that the activities would have been profitable without those events. And while the Tax Court acknowledged the “highly speculative” nature of horse racing, breeding, and training, it stated that the events cited by taxpayers hardly accounted for their “unbroken string” of more than 25 years of losses. Further, although taxpayers cited the potential to earn a substantial profit with one outstanding horse, that contention—the possibility of a speculative profit—wasn't enough to outweigh the absence of profits for a sustained period of years.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's five-year history of increasing losses from his automobile racing activity indicated a lack of profit objective where he took no steps to increase profitability despite the persistent losses. He never considered participating in a greater number of races at the track near his home, nor did he make any effort to race in tracks farther away from his home, even though they awarded considerably higher prize money. Moreover, the taxpayer didn't expand his efforts to get sponsors to offset some of his expenses.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's “persistent and significant” losses of $570,000 from his car-racing activities over an eight-year span were a key factor in the determination that it wasn't a profit-seeking activity for him. The racing activity was a tool that helped increase taxpayer's income from selling communications equipment, thereby lessening his concern over whether profits or losses were generated by it. Taxpayer kept accurate records, but only to satisfy the tax requirements and not as a tool to achieve profitability. He invested heavily in capital assets for the activity and got marketing materials from a design firm, but these factors were consistent with IRS's theory that it was merely taxpayer's “expensive hobby.” The Tax Court also found taxpayer's claim that he no longer derived personal enjoyment from racing cars (“the thrill is gone”) to lack credibility.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' tournament fishing activity wasn't for profit where they incurred almost $1.5 million in expenses to win $500,000 in prizes. They suffered losses for four straight years, but took no meaningful action to reverse the trend. Similarly, a taxpayer's tournament fishing activity was held to be not for profit in light of continued losses that appeared to indicate that a timeframe for profit was irrelevant. The taxpayer also failed to change his operating methods in a manner that might lead to a profitable result.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer, a full-time financial analyst, wasn't engaged in a sailboat chartering activity with a profit objective where: evidence of his tax motivation was undisputed; the activity had a five-year loss history; and the losses, rather than resulting from unpredictable events, had been projected by the taxpayer. The Tax Court, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, reached this conclusion even though taxpayer had conducted the activity in a businesslike manner.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer, a practicing lawyer, had no profit objective in his horse racing/breeding activities. A principal factor that led the Tax Court to this conclusion was taxpayer's continuing pattern of losses and his failure to keep businesslike records (see ¶  M-5834 ). The court also noted that, although taxpayer's ultimate goal was to make a living with horse racing/breeding and farming activities, he didn't abandon his lucrative legal practice.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's 20-year history of losses from his photography and art activity, during which period there were almost no sales, and his casual approach to marketing, led the Tax Court to conclude that the taxpayer lacked a profit objective. The taxpayer argued that his persistence and dedication to this activity was proof of his profit objective. But the Tax Court said that this persistence suggested a great dedication to art but none to business concerns such as earning a profit.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's eight consecutive years of losses, ending with the tax year at issue, in the activity of metal mining and refining accompanied by no steps to increase his income or decrease his expenses was a factor showing no profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Similarly, substantial losses from activities as distributors in every year in which taxpayers engaged in those activities (the eight years before the year of the Tax Court trial, plus projected losses for the year in which that trial took place) indicated that taxpayers weren't engaged in those activities with a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's five-year history of losses in her direct-marketing activities indicated the absence of a profit motive. The court rejected taxpayer's argument that the early losses were merely start-up losses caused by her having to switch companies due to unforeseen circumstances. The unforeseen circumstance was the state's shutting down one venture marketing a “tax relief system.” And, in any event, she shifted from activity to activity without analyzing costs or earnings potential. So, the losses were operating losses and not start-up losses. It also wasn't significant that in later years she showed a small profit, because this was attributable to taxpayer's ceasing to claim questionable deductions such as home office expenses and wages paid to her sons.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer lacked a profit motive where the gross receipts from his Amway distributorship greatly increased (from $20,000 to $100,000) over a four-year period, but net losses of $20,000 a year persisted due to increases in cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Even though taxpayer spent a lot of time on the activity, he was motivated by personal considerations such as discounts he got on products for personal use and use in his other businesses.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers, a married couple, didn't have a profit motive for their Amway distributorship where increasingly large yearly net losses greatly exceeded their annual gross receipts.</div>\n\n<div>On the other hand, mere failure to make a profit doesn't, by itself, indicate that the taxpayer isn't engaged in a trade or business.</div>\n\n<div>The Tax Court originally held, in a “close call,” that taxpayer conducted her gambling activities with a profit motive in 2004 and 2005, despite losses each year. Other sources of income were disposed of, and her gambling activities were regular and continuous. Taxpayer was allowed to claim her gambling losses (up to the amount of her gambling winnings, see ¶  M-6101 ) on Schedule C instead of Schedule A ( ¶  M-6105 ). But once taxpayer's history of substantial losses continued through 2008, the Tax Court held no profit motive existed for those later years, so she was no longer in a trade or business as of 2006.</div>\n\n<div>The following activities were engaged in for profit despite a history of losses: <ul> <li> an oil and gas venture where the taxpayer received only $140,000 on a $6,250,000 highly risky investment in oil and gas leases and deducted $4,500,000 in the same year on account of abandonment or worthlessness of the underlying leases. </li> <li> a joint venture organized for the purpose of putting together oil and mining deals in exchange for commissions, even though the venture was unsuccessful in putting together any deals and made no money. </li> <li> a dog kennel operated by a taxpayer in the coal business. </li> <li> sickness and death benefits paid by a fraternal organization in excess of dues. </li> <li> a granite quarry enterprise where there was no adequate access route to the quarry, but taxpayer hoped that someday one would be built. </li> <li> sculpting and painting activities. A history of losses is less persuasive in the art field than in other fields. Many artists have to struggle before they make profits or receive public acclaim that results in an increase in the value of their artwork. So, taxpayer's ten year history of losses didn't prove that she engaged in her art activities without the requisite profit motive. </li> <li> a horse breeding activity that had losses in each of the six years at issue. Drought and a decreased market for horses contributed to the losses. Taxpayer had taken steps to improve profitability, and expected to realize a profit once he established a viable stock of horses for breeding. In fact, the activity showed a profit later. </li> <li> horse breeding and racing activities, where, although taxpayers had a consistent history of losses, they abated their losses over time and were capable of making up their losses from earlier years, because their horses were beginning to be entered in high stakes races. </li> <li> a rodeo and horse breeding and training business, where the taxpayers, an airline pilot and a flight attendant, respectively, had losses in the first two years due to circumstances beyond their control. IRS said that the death and illnesses of some horses and the manager's bad conduct were due to taxpayers' absences, but the court held that they reasonably relied on a qualified manager during their absences. </li> <li> a cattle farm operation, where taxpayer's losses for the years at issue could be partially explained by uncontroverted proof of a decline in cattle sales, and taxpayer's poor health. And while taxpayer's cumulative losses from the farm over the years were substantial, those losses became less significant in light of the substantial appreciation in the farmland's value. Taxpayer also experimented with different farming methods in an effort to increase profitability. </li> <li> a farming activity that taxpayer conducted on 15 acres of overgrown pasture and 15 acres of a deteriorated citrus grove. Although he made the citrus grove into one of the finest in the area, taxpayer wasn't able to make a profit. Citrus growers in the state hadn't made a profit for the last 20 to 25 years. Although the taxpayer's expectation of profit from the farming activity was unreasonable, the court believed that the taxpayer had a bona fide profit objective. He was no more unreasonable than all other citrus growers in the area. </li> <li> a limousine service, where taxpayer had losses for six consecutive years. Most of the losses were attributable to depreciation, and taxpayer believed that the Rolls Royces used in the business would increase in value or hold their value. </li> <li> a jet charter service in which taxpayer incurred substantial losses every year he operated the business (13). Taxpayer conducted the operation in a business-like manner, devoted 30 hours a week to it, relied on skilled experts, and had great success in other business ventures. He wasn't an airplane hobbyist. Losses were due in part to unforeseen circumstances and he made appropriate changes in the business to try to improve the situation. The court also noted that the losses grew progressively smaller over time and cash flow increased. </li> <li> a hair-braiding salon that never showed a profit during eight years of operation, where the taxpayer had a genuine profit motive when she opened the business, and it failed for reasons beyond her control (i.e., the 2008–2010 financial crisis, an over-concentration of similar businesses, and a change in taste among customers). She didn't close the business earlier because she was bound by a long-term rental contract, and wanted to protect her credit rating. Taxpayer had only a modest income from her other job, and suffered genuine out-of-pocket losses. She kept business records and made reasonable marketing efforts. The salon was no hobby. </li> </ul> </div>",

        "text": "<div>Although a reasonable expectation of profit is not required for purposes of the hobby loss rules (see ¶  M-5801 ), the facts and circumstances (without regard to the taxpayer's subjective intent) must indicate that the taxpayer entered the activity, or continued the activity, with the objective of making a profit.</div>\n\n<div>IRS says that the taxpayer must have a financial and economic forecast for the activity, as demonstrated in a formal written business plan. The plan must be realistic, not a “fantasy” profit and loss statement. It must show a short and long range forecast for the activity, and allow for changes due to potential unforeseen and fortuitous circumstances. </div>\n\n<div class='match' >The Sixth Circuit held that the correct standard is whether the taxpayer entered the activity with the objective of making a profit, keeping in mind that a small chance of making a large profit can support a profit motive. It reversed a case in which the Tax Court had applied the standard of whether taxpayer had a reasonable expectation of profit. In remanding the case, it said that if the Tax Court found that the mine taxpayer had invested in included an area that would have resulted in a large recovery of gold in at short time, it should hold that the profit motive requirement was satisfied.</div>\n\n<div>The proper test is whether the taxpayer had a actual and honest profit objective when he undertook the venture, not whether he expected a profit. One may start with the sincere purpose of eventually reaping a profit but in the belief that the probability of financial success is small or even remote. That is, the taxpayer does not really expect a profit but, nonetheless, is willing to take the gamble.</div>\n\n<div>Thus, a taxpayer who engages in an activity in which there is a small chance of a large profit, such as a person who invests in a wildcat oil well or an inventor, can qualify under this standard, even though the expectation of profit might be considered unreasonable, and so can a poor person engaged in what appears to be an inefficient farming operation. Still, a vain hope that at some remote day a profit might result is not sufficient to give a farming operation the character of a business.</div>\n\n<div>The Fourth Circuit confirmed the bona fide profit motive standard when it declined to overrule a Tax Court decision denying a doctor's deductions for farming activities and held that the taxpayer failed to show that the court applied the erroneous “reasonable profit motive” standard instead of “sincere and honest” or “bona fide profit motive” standard.</div>\n\n<div>There was a bona fide profit objective, even though the expectation of profit may not have been reasonable, where: <ul> <li> a taxpayer, who inherited the farm which he operated, obtained outside employment in order to offset his farm losses and did not operate the farm at a loss to offset his other income. The court said the bleak financial picture of the farm activity was explainable more by inefficient operations than by the absence of the taxpayer's expectation of a profit. </li> <li> an artist craved personal recognition and believed that selling her work for profit represented the attainment of that recognition. </li> <li> a taxpayer invested in a soil treatment process and gave credible testimony that he believed that the process would allow him to realize a fortune. Moreover, this testimony was supported by his diligence in implementing the process. He supplied funds, bought and rented equipment, and solicited accounts and clients. </li> <li> a taxpayer devoted substantial spare time in attempting to develop materials and to market them, although he did not have any business income from the activity. </li> <li> a full-time airline flight attendant had a renewable franchise to market and distribute video cassette instruction programs for use in elementary grades of parochial schools. </li> <li> taxpayers marketed and distributed racquetball racquets under a franchise agreement. </li> <li> partnerships were formed to manufacture, sell, and distribute technology to automatically identify and monitor ingress and egress from large parking facilities. They entered into agreements with X to research and develop this project. The partnerships' expert testified that if the project had been developed as originally envisioned, it would have saved airports millions of dollars and that partnership profits would have been comparable to the partnerships' projections. The court was persuaded that had the project been successfully developed, a sales price of $3 million was reasonable. The partners were not unreasonable in relying on the information provided by X as to the project's feasibility. The court found that IRS didn't prove that the partnerships didn't have economic profit as their primary objective. </li> <li> taxpayer turned down a promotion and quit his job to devote himself to selling solar heaters. He had frequent sales appointments and held solar heater seminars in his home. </li> <li> taxpayer, who was engaged in management consulting, (1) spent more than 20 hours per week on the activity (while also employed for 40 hours per week in another activity), (2) was a member of an industry association, (3) promoted his business by direct mail, magazine advertisements and personal contacts, (4) hired a part-time secretary, (5) kept some business records, and (6) over a three-year period tried several approaches for increasing profitability. The Tax Court stated that the proper standard is whether there exists an “actual and honest objective of making a profit;” whether that objective is reasonable is not the standard, although, in determining whether the requisite profit motive exists, objective facts are given greater weight than the taxpayer's statement of intent. On the facts given, the standard was found to be satisfied, even though the activity was ultimately abandoned after it failed to return a profit after approximately four years. </li> <li> taxpayer worked hard in his attempt to achieve profitability of his three acre farm, was knowledgeable about farming, consulted with government experts, and changed his method of cultivating in an effort to improve production. Some of his difficulty in turning a profit from his farm activity was due to circumstances beyond his control, e. g. his pear trees died from rot and many of his chickens were killed by his dogs and his neighbor's tomcat. </li> </ul> </div>\n\n<div>There was no evidence of a bona fide intent to make a profit where: <ul> <li> taking into account all costs that taxpayer associated with his plant nursery business, the venture could never produce a profit. </li> <li> taxpayer rented an A-frame house that had no plumbing to traveling evangelists for little or no rent. Although he “charged” $80 per month rent, he actually collected only $20 rent for the year and incurred expenses of over $6,000. </li> <li> taxpayer developed an information management idea which included plans to build an entrepreneurial library and the promotion of his total productive employment system theory. Taxpayer failed to explain how he would raise the money to build, staff, or maintain the library, where it would be located, and whom it would serve. Taxpayer did not prove he had sufficient expertise to develop a library and did not show how much time he spent on this project. Furthermore, taxpayer had no inventory, employees, licenses to operate, separate business phones or records. </li> <li> taxpayers' leased their 80% interest in realty to a Greek Orthodox Church. Previously, the taxpayers had donated the other 20% interest to the Church and had continued to pay liabilities on that interest. Taxpayers' sole purpose in entering into the leasing arrangement with the Church was to enable it later acquire the property. There was no evidence that the taxpayers had any intent other than to help the Church. The fact that the taxpayers sold their 80% interest to the Church at a profit didn't negate the fact that their intent in buying and renting the property was to help the Church. </li> <li> an S corporation, engaged in the recycling business, leased farmland on which it maintained minimal herds of livestock and did nothing to improve the quality of its crop of organically grown almonds. During the three years at issue, the farming expenses totaled $438,663, while receipts over the farm's 6-year existence totaled $25,820. Despite expert farming and financial advice on how to increase profits, nothing was done to change the farming activity. The farm activity was continued for the purpose of using its losses to substantially reduced the income from the S corporation's highly profitable recycling business. </li> <li> after seven years of working on a manuscript, a lawyer couldn't establish that it was likely a publisher would accept it when it was finished. His self-serving testimony and the testimony of his law school professor didn't provide any way of determining the manuscript's potential profitability. </li> <li> a full-time office supervisor was also a part-time singer. </li> <li> In considering the deductibility of expenditures made by partnerships relating to their arrangement with a Brazilian company to research and develop monoclonal antibody conjugates, the Fifth Circuit said that the profit objective test to be applied was whether the facts and circumstances indicated that the taxpayers made the expenditures “primarily in furtherance of a bona fide profit objective independent of tax consequences.” (If so, the deductions attributable to the arrangement would be allowed.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed the Tax Court and denied the deductions because the partnerships had purchased the research projects with the primary intent of realizing tax advantages. </li> <li> In a case appealable to the Fifth Circuit, the test applied by the Tax Court to determine whether partnerships formed to engage in a research and development project had a profit objective under Code Sec. 183 , was whether the partnerships had a “primary” objective of making a profit. The Tax Court so ruled because it found that was the test of the Fifth Circuit as stated in Agro Science, (footnote 4). But the Tax Court found that the Fifth Circuit's test was in conflict with the test applied by the Tax Court in the context of Code Sec. 183 . The Tax Court said that its test for determining profit objective focuses “on the economic viability of the transaction[s] and on the actual and honest nature of the [partnerships'] profit objective.” </li> </ul> <strong><div class='ria'>RIA observation:</strong> The Fifth Circuit's opinion in Agro Science (footnote 4) affirmed the Tax Court's decision in that case without indicating that the Fifth Circuit was applying a different profit objective test than the one applied by the Tax Court. It appears that the Fifth Circuit was not aware that it was stating a test in Agro Science which differed from the Tax Court's test. <ul> <li> taxpayer bought a share of a refrigerated container to produce rental income without adequately investigating the feasibility of the plan or the value of the container. Taxpayer had no background in the business, exhibited no interest in following up on his investment, and never had control over the container. The court did not find it credible that in a year in which his income was just $35,000, taxpayer would invest $26,000 to generate a unknown amount of future income. The court concluded taxpayer was motivated by the potential tax benefits the plan offered and not a profit potential. </li> <li> taxpayer, who worked full time, was engaged in drag racing approximately two weekends per month. He testified that any profit from his racing activity would result from the accumulation of “national points” in regional and national “points meets.” Taxpayer failed to adequately explain what a “points meet” was, or what was required to qualify for a national meet. In addition, the Court said that his testimony, that he spent two weekends per month at the race track, was exaggerated. </li> <li> taxpayer, a successful business executive in the garment industry, entered into a professional golfer/sponsor agreement with his son, who had lost his enthusiasm for the garment industry business and, after winning a tournament at a local golf club, felt that because professional golf was undergoing a substantial increase in growth and popularity, it was a good time to make a career change and become a golf professional. Taxpayer failed to make a financial analysis of the sponsorship as a profit-seeking venture or make any attempt to calculate when there might be a return on his sponsorship investment. Taxpayer did not enter into the sponsorship agreement with an honest objective of making a profit, but rather to give his son the opportunity to make a career change and become a professional golfer. The financial support that taxpayer gave to his son under the sponsorship agreement was no different than that of any parent who decides to help a child financially with educational expenses or with expenses for other career-seeking endeavors.</div> </li> </ul> </div>",

All facts and circumstances must be taken into account in determining whether an activity's engaged in for profit, see ¶  M-5832 et seq.</div>\n\n<div>A profit motive's indicated where a taxpayer has related experience in the activity and keeps up with current practices.</div>\n\n<div>A computer-equipment purchase and leaseback arrangement was a for-profit activity where taxpayer was experienced in leasing computers for his company for many years, played a lead role in other investment decisions for his company, and was sufficiently educated and experienced to evaluate the transaction in a business-like manner.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer, a college professor teaching computer courses, operated a software and sales business for profit. He devoted a large amount of time and effort to this business and approached it in a business-like fashion. The business was integrally related to courses he taught at the university, and much of the knowledge he gained in the classroom was put to work in his consulting activities. Although his expenses exceeded his fees in the tax year in question, he expected to make a profit in the future, based on his preparation and motivation.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's qualifications and accomplishments as a college professor of theater factored into the finding that he had profit motive for writing plays. Taxpayer had a Ph.D. in drama, and had published numerous articles on dramatic criticism and theory.</div>\n\n<div>A partnership's purchase of a 10% interest in the net profits of a motion picture film was an activity engaged in for profit, despite the fact that over 80% of its investment was in the form of a nonrecourse note, which the court ruled wasn't a bona fide debt. The court pointed to the fact that: (a) one of the principals in the partnership had been involved in the financing arrangements for over 400 films, plays, and television shows; (b) another principal was an entertainment lawyer for 38 years in the movie, theatre, and television fields in which he represented writers, producers, distributors, directors, and performers; and (c) a third principal had 35 years experience in all phases of the entertainment field.</div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer who grew up on a farm and kept up with current practices through reading and consultation with experienced persons was able to show a profit motive in a farming activity, although he also had another occupation.</div>\n\n<div>A former boxing champion bought a farm for his mother and other family members in the area where he had grown up and worked as a farm field hand. He hired two successive full-time, salaried managers to oversee farming operations. He also sought advice, from state agricultural representatives and a local university extension source, about getting a sufficient water supply to establish a duck hunting preserve. Even though it may have been unreasonable for the taxpayer to expect his relatives to run a profitable farm, objective reasonableness isn't required to establish profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>The Tax Court held that hope of profit appeared to be the principal objective of a taxpayer who bought a stock car and drove it in races until it was demolished later in the year. Before buying the car, he had some expertise and experience in racing, had consulted with an expert, and had experience driving other peoples' cars for pay.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >Taxpayer, a teacher who was also a professional golfer, had a profit motive for his golfing activity where he attended a business course for golfers and assisted a professional golfer from whom he also took lessons. His training included not only course work but practice in a variety of areas, including the operation of a golf shop, teaching methods, and golf techniques. But a taxpayer who took none of the steps taken by the taxpayer in Kimbrough (footnote 13) was found to have no profit motive for his golfing activity. Similarly, a taxpayer who engages in an activity for a period of years, but who doesn't conduct the activity in a business-like manner that a person engaged in the same activity would, had difficulty proving a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>A quarter horse farm operated at a loss for eight years by taxpayer and his son, who both had expertise in the field, wasn't an activity engaged in for profit. The taxpayer, whose primary business was as an oil and gas lease broker, rode and showed horses competitively for pleasure and was a judge for American Quarter Horse Association events. In addition, his son was an experienced trainer. But the Tax Court found that the taxpayer failed to operate the horse farm activity in a business-like manner in that he failed to keep books and records, seek expert advice, or take remedial actions to increase profitability during the operation's protracted period of losses.</div>\n\n<div>Although ultimately concluding that taxpayers, a married couple, didn't have a profit motive for their horse breeding, training, and racing activities, the Tax Court found that their extensive knowledge about horses and the horse industry, plus the fact that they consulted with knowledgeable persons, including professional trainers and veterinarians, “slightly” favored their position. The couple's expertise was partly because of the taxpayer-husband's years of breaking and training horses, but also from their continued study of bloodlines and breeding, training, and racing techniques. They also consulted an accountant for business and tax advice. But the court noted that, in the face of mounting losses, it would have been prudent to seek further business advice.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's automobile racing activities weren't engaged in for profit, even though he had experience in amateur racing, because taxpayer: (1) didn't have expertise in the underlying economics of automobile racing; (2) consulted an individual to determine the potential profitability of racing, but that individual had neither experience in making a profit from professional racing nor raced professionally; (3) didn't consult with an accountant to advise him on the financial aspects of racing activities; and (4) didn't evaluate the overall cost or capital investment relative to the potential earnings.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' tournament fishing activity wasn't for profit where they never investigated the factors affecting the profitability of the activity. Although taxpayers were expert fishers and studied tournament fishing from a contestant's point of view, they never studied it as a business, such as by researching the expenses they were likely to incur.</div>\n\n<div>Where the taxpayer, who had some real estate development experience, consulted informally with several people including some contractors before entering into a land development venture, the taxpayer's experience, together with the consultations, weighed in favor of a finding that the taxpayer had a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer who considered herself a gambling expert and had gambled for 10 years engaged in regular and continuous (40 hours per week) gambling activity (playing slot machines) in a business-like manner where she employed a strategy to improve her chances of winning (i.e., identifying and playing slot machines that were likely due to pay out), and after some initial losses, changed her strategy to help her win (focusing on winning smaller amounts at a time, rather than trying to recoup old losses all at once with bigger payouts). The court found that the continuity and regularity of her gambling activity strongly suggested that she was an expert at slot machines. Taxpayer also consulted regularly with casino employees to further her gambling strategy, and watched other gamblers to understand what she believed to be slot machine payout patterns.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer, a part-time professor of modern history engaged in research and writing on France, had substantial expertise regarding his subject matter and some experience in publishing his work, but established no expertise on how to make a profit from the activities. This factor, along with a history of losses and the failure to act in a business-like manner, resulted in the court finding taxpayer lacked a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Where the taxpayer had experience working with classic Plymouth automobiles and in operating a business, his activity of restoring this make of automobile was business-like, even though it was unsophisticated. Most of the nine factors in Reg § 1.183-2(b)(9) ( ¶  M-5832 et seq.) favored the taxpayer.</div>",

Thus, there was a profit motive where land was leased to sharecroppers during years that taxpayer was unable to operate it due to lack of farm equipment during the wartime and postwar shortages. </div>\n\n<div>Where a taxpayer, because of his failing health, was unable to devote a great deal of time or energy to his company's affairs, these circumstances explained why the company was not profitable, as opposed to establishing a lack of profit objective, especially in light of the company's earlier profitability and the taxpayer's success in taking steps to improve the company's performance in later years. </div>\n\n<div>A doctor (taxpayer), an avid sailor who previously had bought and sold a series of sailboats at a profit, had a profit motive for a yachting activity he engaged in with his professor-wife where an unfortunate combination of events prevented him from actually realizing a profit. He bought a 50-foot racing sailboat (at a bargain price) in order to join a sailing association that held annual races and promised sponsorship income to its members. He expected to profit by getting sponsorships, forming a franchise league for sailboat racing, boat chartering, and reselling the boat. The boat, which was crewed mostly by professionals, sailed in several races and chartered trips, and was featured in a clothing catalogue and a deodorant commercial. However, the drug companies taxpayer had expected as sponsors (because of his profession) came under Congressional investigation, the sailing association disbanded, he lost two principal charterers, the international racing rules changed, and the imposition of a luxury tax caused industry layoffs. Additionally, taxpayer was sidelined by bypass surgery and was beset by malpractice suits and other financial pressures, including embezzlement by his pension plan administrator, to the point where he couldn't keep the boat in first-class condition. </div>\n\n<div>On the other hand, a plastic surgeon (taxpayer) could have foreseen the excessive repair and restoration costs that resulted in the losses he claimed for activities relating to a luxury Feadship (top-of-the-line) yacht he bought knowing it was in a distressed condition. Although taxpayer had no expertise in owning, restoring or chartering yachts, or in buying them for resale, a good faith, diligent and timely investigation into the condition of the yacht and the nature of the luxury yacht charter business would have eliminated most of the surprise as to those costs, and would have given him the information necessary to make a reasoned and calculated attempt to make the venture profitable. </div>\n\n<div>A series of misfortunes didn't prevent finding a profit motive where taxpayer tried planting different crops on his farm, but sales were low due to competition from larger, more sophisticated farms. He attempted to raise cattle, but most of them died from an infection caused by a rare parasite in water they had been drinking. He tried to establish a duck preserve; however, the farm had no watershed of its own. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers, husband and wife, raised and bred horses on their farm “for profit” despite a history of losses. The losses were the result of unforeseen circumstances beyond taxpayers' control, and they adjusted their activities accordingly. Before heart problems and injuries from a car accident forced her to cut back, the wife spent about 35-40 hours a week managing the farm's day-to-day operations, and was also active in several horse industry organizations. When the husband lost his job as a nurse anesthetist, the couple filed for bankruptcy to protect and maintain their investment in the horse activity, and were required by the bankruptcy court to make monthly payments on the mortgage they had incurred to buy horses. A foal produced by taxpayers' prize-winning mare suffered a leg injury and had to be put to sleep. Failing to sell any horses, taxpayers planned to begin boarding and training horses, teaching classes, and operating a tack shop to sell horse equipment. The contractor they hired to build a large barn for use in those activities went bankrupt, so taxpayers built several smaller barns to reduce some of their boarding costs. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' horse breeding and racing operation was held to be an activity engaged in for profit, despite a consistent history of losses, where those losses were in part due to unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances beyond taxpayers' control which abruptly ended the racing careers, and in some instances the lives, of several of their horses. For example, five horses died in accidents at the racetrack, one died after producing a foal, two developed tendon problems, and one developed a flesh-eating disease. </div>\n\n<div>But in another case, taxpayers' claim that unforeseen circumstances, such as an injury to their stallion, a foal's death, and another horse's bowed tendon, caused the losses they sustained in their horse breeding activities for the years at issue failed to persuade the court that they had a profit motive for those activities. While taxpayers claimed that a horse expert had said the stallion would have been profitable if he hadn't been injured, the stallion's performance in competition was never better than the intermediate dressage level. It was unknown whether the stallion would have reached the highest dressage level if he hadn't been injured, or if taxpayers' horse operations would have been profitable absent the injuries to the other horses. Moreover, taxpayers failed to show that the actions they took to correct their operations after those unforeseen events were intended to make the horse breeding more profitable. Also, these events occurred at least five years before the first year at issue. Similarly, the unforeseen circumstances cited by taxpayers—characterized as mishaps and injuries that contributed to the failure of their first prize stallion to reach his full potential—did not satisfactorily account for the history of losses (for 23 of 26 years) from their horse-related activity (showing and breeding “cutting horses”) and, thus, taxpayers didn't prove a profit motive. The mishaps included colic suffered by the horse, remedial training required to reverse undesirable training given the horse by a hired trainer, ankle injuries suffered by taxpayer-wife (W) that kept her from riding for six months, a crippling leg injury suffered by the horse, and a failed attempt to lease the horse for breeding. However, the colic and retraining took place during the two years the taxpayers earned significant profits and the taxpayers didn't explain why they didn't seek another rider for the horse while W was injured. The court rejected taxpayers attempts to characterize their activity as a lengthy startup period (11 years) spent developing the first prize stallion's value, followed by the period of mishaps, and then by a lengthy period developing the value of a second prize stallion. </div>\n\n<div>Despite losses over several years, taxpayers' farm operation was an activity engaged in for profit. Taxpayers in the thoroughbred breeding business suffered unforeseen losses from a high rate of abortion in the brood mares, which occurred because the pastures on which they were grazing were contaminated with a toxic fungus. The taxpayers replanted 45 acres of pasture land at a substantial cost and purchased several well-bred mares to enhance its thoroughbred business. During this period, however, the entire southeast entered into a severe four-year drought. As a result, the first two or three efforts in reestablishing the pastures were unsuccessful. In addition, there was a drastic drop in the average and median prices for yearlings throughout the thoroughbred industry. Although the taxpayers experimented with new sources of revenue such as boarding polo ponies (which generated substantial revenues), this activity was hindered by the severe droughts, which limited the farm's grazing potential and the number of polo horses that could be boarded at any given time. Further, taxpayers lost one of their best clients, whose polo career ended when he was shot. </div>\n\n<div>Similarly, taxpayer's horse breeding operation was considered an activity engaged in for profit, even though taxpayer had suffered losses over several years, because some of the losses were due to unexpected setbacks. Taxpayer had tried to breed Paso Fino-quality horses, but when he realized that he didn't have the mares to do so and was instead merely selling “pleasure” and “performance” quality horses, he sought to improve his stable. But because one mare in stock always produced twin offspring (an undesirable trait in the Fino horse industry), taxpayer “pinched off” one of the mare's ovaries each time it was bred so it delivered only one offspring. This, and taxpayer's decision to use embryonic transfers (another expensive procedure), caused taxpayer to incur increased veterinary costs. After another of taxpayer's horses, purchased for $30,000, failed to meet expectations, taxpayer gelded it and then sold it for only $2,000. When another horse suffered a broken hoof after kicking its stall, taxpayer incurred $5,000 in veterinary bills in the hope of fixing the horse's gait and thus maintaining its value. And taxpayer was forced to euthanize a five-day-old foal with an arthritic condition. </div>\n\n<div>Severe unforeseeable weather conditions and taxpayer's attempts to make his farm land more productive were factors indicating that taxpayer had a profit motive. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's losses over 15 years of cattle farming didn't prove the absence of profit motive where they experienced two hurricanes, cattle disease, cattle food poisoning, and a drought. One taxpayer suffered allergic reactions from some of the farm work. They operated the farm in a business-like manner, followed the advice of experts, and devoted 40 hours per week each to working on the farm. </div>\n\n<div>Although taxpayer's farm produced losses for ten years in a row, much of his losses were caused by storms, diseases, and other unexpected events. He never used the farm as a showplace. He had operated another farm profitably. </div>\n\n<div>Another taxpayers' losses could be explained by the fact that three horses out of seven available for racing suffered broken knee or ankle bones, a promising horse bought for racing two years earlier proved to be of little value and was sold for a loss, and another promising horse developed the dangerous habit of running into its stall and was sold. </div>\n\n<div>Similarly, taxpayers had a profit motive for their show horse farm, although they suffered a severe setback when their most promising horse had to be destroyed. </div>\n\n<div>Where damage to the yacht prevented the tax year in question from being profitable, but the owner of the yacht chartering operation intended to make a profit, and actually made a small profit in the preceding tax year, the court ruled that a business won't be turned into a hobby merely because the owner finds it pleasurable. </div>\n\n<div>A ski lodge was an activity entered into for profit, despite eight years of losses, where, shortly after taxpayer entered the lodging market, it was saturated with competitors, there were a number of years of below average snowfall, and a gasoline shortage kept skiers away. </div>\n\n<div>A timber farm was a for-profit activity despite taxpayers' failure to cut and sell any of the timber during the years in issue. Soon after taxpayers bought the timber farm, timber prices fell dramatically in the U. S. and remained below the estimated costs petitioner would incur to harvest the timber. Accordingly, taxpayers postponed the cutting, harvesting, and sale of any of the standing timber on the timber farm. The court rejected IRS's argument that because of taxpayers' failure to cut and sell any of the timber during the years in issue, taxpayers' activity should be regarded only as startup activity, not an existing trade or business or for-profit activity. Typically, on a timber farm individual trees are harvested only once every 35 to 60 years. Nothing indicated that the taxpayers ever abandoned their profit objective with regard to the timber farm: they simply deferred cutting and selling the timber because of an unexpected decline in timber prices. </div>\n\n<div>Where taxpayer's rental apartment was in a run-down, high crime area, her inability to find a tenant for ten years didn't negate a profit motive. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer sustained losses every year from his jet charter service, but was held to have a profit motive in part because the losses were partly due to unforeseen safety problems with his jet. </div>\n\n<div>Similarly, the Tax Court found that taxpayer's airplane leasing business was operated for profit, despite a record of increasing losses. The first year loss wasn't surprising because the airplane wasn't available for service until December and was therefore rented for only a few hours of flying time. The losses in the two succeeding years were due to the deaths of a key employee and most of the pilots in an airplane crash. This ended nearly all charter activity at the airport and effectively doomed the enterprise but didn't disprove taxpayer's profit motive in the first year. </div>\n\n<div>In another airplane activities case, the taxpayer—who never reported a profit from his jet service activity during its six years' duration—claimed, unsuccessfully, that his losses from the activity were due to an unforeseen circumstance, namely the failure of an initial public offering (IPO) that would have resulted in a profitable level of need for his jet service. But, in fact, the losses were preventable by the taxpayer, as he had the option to sell back his interest in the jet after the failure of the IPO, and didn't do so. The court said the evidence showed that the taxpayer's keeping his interest in the jet—as well as his later trading up to a more expensive jet—reflected his decision that the convenience of personal travel by private jet, and perhaps the tax benefits of losses from the jet service activity, justified the costs of continuing ownership of the interest.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >A taxpayer entered into a land development venture and bought a bulldozer for use in the venture. Because of various legal problems, the taxpayer was unable to develop the land. The taxpayer attempted to find a profitable use for the bulldozer, but was unsuccessful. The inability to make a profit was due to unforeseen circumstances and didn't show a lack of a profit motive. Moreover, the taxpayer's attempt to sell the bulldozer didn't show that the taxpayer was withdrawing from the business, since, although the taxpayer was unable to rent the bulldozer, it remained available for rental. </div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer's continuing losses in his cattle-raising activity didn't indicate a lack of profit motive where some of the losses were due partly to drought and depressed market conditions. Economic constraints prevented him from entering into a planned stocker-calf operation (in which weaned calves are bought, fattened on pasture and sold for profit). To maximize his farmland's productivity, he went into a cow-calf operation (in which cows are bred and calves are sold). </div>\n\n<div>Another taxpayer had a profit motive although he was forced to reduce operations because of a labor shortage during war years. But a taxpayer's claim that losses of yacht chartering activity were due to unforeseen circumstances (repeated equipment failures and seller's and manufacturer's failures to correct the yacht's defects) was rejected. Taxpayer didn't conduct the preliminary investigation expected from someone motivated primarily in making a profit, that would have alerted him to the likelihood of some of the problems. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's argument that her growing losses in the operation of her bookkeeping and tax service were caused by the poor economic conditions and beyond her control was rejected because she didn't prove that poor economic conditions contributed to her losses. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' argument that losses from their dog-breeding activity were caused by progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retina that causes blindness in dogs, was rejected. Though the taxpayers asserted that this disease caused an unanticipated increase in expenses because they were required to purchase new stock for breeding, in fact, the taxpayers didn't know that any of their dogs even had PRA until after the years in issue. The taxpayers' losses were largely the result of the high cost of dog boarding and handling, and not from the purchase of breeding stock. PRA didn't have a significant impact on the taxpayers' dog-breeding activity during the tax years in question. </div>\n\n<div>The Sixth Circuit, reversing the Tax Court's finding that the taxpayers' activities were not engaged in for profit, held that beyond controversy the losses suffered by taxpayers engaged in fish farming, Christmas tree, timber, and row crop undertakings were caused at least in part by unanticipated, drought, heat, and deer damage during the years at issue. The Tax Court had rejected this argument because the taxpayers didn't attempt to quantify losses attributable to each cause, and didn't specify whether the drought took place during the years in which they had or had not planted crops. In addition, the Tax Court reasoned that while the taxpayers alleged that farmers in the area suffered from deer depredation, not only did they not introduce evidence that deer damage contributed to their losses, evidence suggested that there were salt licks on the property to attract deer and other animals. On the other hand, the Six Circuit reasoned that evidence that salt licks and feed boxes had been placed on the taxpayers' farm in no way proved the inherently absurd speculation that the taxpayers had deliberately schemed to destroy their crops by attracting ravenous deer onto their farm. To the contrary, the taxpayers' activities could have been more logically construed to lure deer away from the crops, to areas where they could be easily hunted, in order to promoting the well being of the taxpayers' farm. </div>\n\n<div>A decline in the horse breeding market wasn't an unforeseen circumstance where the taxpayer failed to conduct even a basic investigation of the profitability of horse breeding before beginning the activity. Therefore, the taxpayer couldn't use the purportedly unexpected decline in market conditions to support his position that he had a profit motive with respect to the activity. </div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer couldn't explain away her substantial losses (more than $1.1 million over 14 years) from breeding, raising and racing thoroughbred horses by arguing that unforeseen events negatively affected her activities, where she took no steps to put herself in a position to earn the substantial profit necessary to recoup those losses. The events taxpayer cited—death of one broodmare, barren broodmare, poor performance of racing thoroughbreds, and negative economic conditions—were not of a type that should have caught her by surprise. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers argued that their nearly 20 years of losses in cattle-raising and deer-herding activities were due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control—namely, price fluctuations and drought conditions during that period. The Tax Court found that, on the basis of climate and meteorological data, no drought seems to have occurred during the period and in the region at issue, and that, even if drought had occurred there, that the “unforeseen circumstances” were not in fact unforeseen. Taxpayer-husband was raised on a cattle ranch in the part of the country where he conducted his operations, and knew or should have known that the region was susceptible to drought, and that beef prices often fluctuated. </div>\n\n<div>The unforeseen or fortuitous event must cause the loss or losses at issue in order to be a factor favorable to the taxpayer claiming the loss. Thus, a taxpayer couldn't rely, as a reason for his losses, on the lameness of a horse which he acquired and was training, supposedly for sale at a profit, where the taxpayer couldn't prove that he intended to sell the horse, the value of the horse at the time it went lame or the profit that would have been made on the supposed sale (taking into account the original purchase price of the horse and the cumulative expenses associated with it). For a summary of the multiple factors taken into account by the Tax Court in concluding that the horse breeding and training activity in Drummond (footnote 28.1) wasn't engaged in for profit, see ¶  M-5892 . Similarly, a hurricane that caused damage to property taxpayer owned in another state and misfortunes suffered in taxpayer's computer service business were only tangentially related to taxpayer's cattle ranching activity and thus weren't unforeseen circumstances responsible for the continued (seven year) losses from the cattle ranching activity. The hurricane damage was, in fact, resolved within a relatively short period, impacting only one winter. And, because taxpayer's level of involvement in ranch affairs remained the same before and after the reverses to his computer business, they were not a convincing reason for losses suffered on the ranch. Nor, were drought conditions in the area of the ranch unforeseen circumstances excusing losses since taxpayer knew of the lack of rainfall in the area before purchasing the land he used for grazing. Thus, taxpayer should have been aware of the need to plan for such conditions if he truly intended to make a profit from his property. Rather, seven years after the purchase of the land, an irrigation system was still not in place. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer argued his efforts to earn a profit from his farm were hampered when one of his horses fell into a ditch and died, and when cougars and an English bulldog killed some of his sheep and pygmy angora goats. He also argued that his fir trees had a long growing cycle, thus delaying a harvest. But taxpayer's farm losses were disallowed. No profits were realized in five years of operations. Taxpayer and his wife spent just 10 to 20 hours a week working on the farm. And all meat they “harvested” from their animals was consumed; none was sold. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer should have known that his activity of metal mining and refining involved dangerous or hazardous chemicals subject, at least to a minimal degree, to environmental regulation and that therefore environmental compliance would be a cost of doing business rather than an unforeseeable circumstance preventing him from making a profit. </div>",
