        "title": "M-5860 Time and effort taxpayer spends on an activity as indication of profit motive—hobby losses.",
        "text": "<div>Under the hobby loss rules, deductions attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit are limited, see ¶  M-5800 et seq. All facts and circumstances must be taken into account in determining whether an activity's engaged in for profit, see ¶  M-5832 et seq.</div>\n\n<div>A profit motive can be indicated where the taxpayer devotes much of his own time and effort to the activity, especially if it has no substantial personal or recreational aspects. In other words, the taxpayer's interest in the activity must be more than “passing” or “casual.” For example, a college professor's 40 years of professional involvement with dramatic production indicated he had a profit motive for writing plays. But this factor won't favor the taxpayer if he can't explain how the work he performed related to making a profit.</div>\n\n<div>The Tax Court notes that in a large percentage of decisions where time spent was found to be probative of intent to profit, the taxpayers were devoting more than 30 hours to the enterprise on a weekly basis. And, where lesser amounts have been validated as evidence of profit objective, the expenditures have typically been regular (see ¶  M-5862 ) and consistent.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >A profit motive was indicated where: <ul> <li> taxpayer devoted “nearly all” of his time, “a considerable amount” of time, and “most of” his time. </li> <li> taxpayers devoted 40-60 hours a week to their horse-breeding activity, in addition to having full time jobs. </li> <li> a taxpayer devoted about 40 hours per week to gambling activities (playing slot machines), in addition to the 25 to 35 hours per week she spent running a trucking business. Taxpayer employed a strategy to improve her chances of winning (i.e., identifying and playing slot machines that were likely due to payout), and, after some initial losses, changed her strategy to help her win (focusing on winning smaller amounts at a time, rather than trying to recoup old losses all at once with bigger payouts). Taxpayer also consulted regularly with casino employees to further her gambling strategy, and watched other gamblers to understand what she believed to be slot machine payout patterns. In addition, taxpayer credibly testified that she didn't view gambling as a recreational pursuit, and found no pleasure in gambling (describing it as stressful, tiring, and time consuming). Taxpayer always went to the casinos alone, and while there was focused on winning as much money as possible. </li> <li> taxpayers, a doctor-husband and professor-wife, spent an average of 15 to 20 hours per week on their sailboat racing venture. </li> <li> taxpayer devoted significant time and effort to his gold mining activity. He compressed the 40-hour work week schedule for his full-time job as a field engineer into four 10-hour days, so that he could spend three consecutive days each week mining for gold. Almost every weekend, he left his home on Thursday evening and drove up to 150 miles into the desert to mine for gold. </li> <li> taxpayer devoted 30 hours a week to his jet charter business, despite devoting 50 hours per week to his clothing business. He was involved in every aspect of operations. </li> <li> taxpayer devoted a substantial amount of time working on modifications to his motorcycle and entered several races a year. The fact that he entered fewer races in later years indicated his decision to leave the activity because it was unprofitable. </li> <li> taxpayer worked on his cattle farm seven days a week, and there was no evidence that he endured this physical labor for pleasure. </li> <li> taxpayer, who ran a successful toolmaking business, spent almost all of his free time during the evenings, and on weekends and holidays, raising cattle. A business reorganization that gave his sons more responsibility and control of the toolmaking business allowed him more time to concentrate on his cattle farming. During the years at issue, he worked an average of 50 hours per week on his cattle operation, and only slowed down when his health problems forced him to do so. Moreover, he viewed his cattle activities as “work” rather than pleasure. </li> <li> taxpayer spent several hours daily performing the day-to-day work associated with his horse breeding activity, as well as two and a half days work preparing for each horse show entered. </li> <li> taxpayers (husband and wife) were actively involved in preparing their horses for the show ring during the three years at issue. They spent a substantial amount of time training, showing and caring for their horses, which they didn't ride for pleasure. In one year, the husband spent more than 1,600 hours and the wife spent more than 700 hours on those activities. </li> <li> taxpayers (a married couple) involved in working at the taxpayer-husband's law firm where the taxpayer-wife kept the books, spent more than 20 hours during the week and on weekends working in their horse-related activities. They often performed manual and menial tasks such as feeding and walking the horses and mucking stalls. </li> <li> taxpayer was retired from his previous position and so was able to devote a substantial amount of time to horse breeding and racing activities. He personally visited the facilities where his horses are boarded and trained to inspect the condition of the horses and to consult with the caretakers and trainers. He spent at least four hours a day, six days a week, inspecting his horses and consulting with their trainers. </li> <li> taxpayer with two young children to care for devoted 20 to 25 hours per week to her show horse activity. </li> <li> taxpayer's entire family devoted enormous personal time and effort to their horse-breeding business, such that it was the full-time work of one spouse, the children gave up extracurricular school activities, and one child gave up a part-time job to prepare for and attend horse shows each weekend for eight months of the year. </li> <li> taxpayers' entire family spent considerable time and effort in operating their horse farm. Each family member had specific duties, e.g., the wife would clean the barn and feed and train the horses, the husband would perform routine medical care for the horses and clear and maintain the land, and the children would work several hours a day riding and working in the barn. </li> <li> taxpayers spent only evenings and weekends operating their horse farm, but hired a full-time ranch supervisor. </li> <li> taxpayer, although president of a company that employed 45 people, spent as much as eight to ten hours a day during the haying season on the farm and during the off-season cleared land, did maintenance work, and personally performed or supervised all the farm-related work done. </li> <li> taxpayer spent about 500 hours a year in truck-pulling activities and, through his diligence and devotion of large amounts of time and effort, was ultimately ranked 35th in the nation by a national truck pulling promoter. </li> <li> taxpayer, an engineer, pursued a career as an actor, took acting lessons, retained an agent, prepared a photo portfolio, mailed 250 resumes, joined the actors' guild, and attended numerous screenings and interviews. </li> <li> taxpayer, anticipating retirement and wanting to gain experience in the horse-business, worked 30 hours per week in horse-related activities, participated in the daily grooming and feeding, and bought, sold, and bred horses in the eight years before retirement. </li> <li> the sole owner of a substantial contracting corporation with a fondness for quarter horses, studied everything he could about breeding quarter horses, consulted and retained experienced advisers in the field, attended many horse shows and sales, and studied the genetic background of each horse he bought. Although he had another business, he devoted about 40 hours per week to the horse business and, to save expenses, his wife also worked full time doing the bookkeeping, cleaning stalls, and grooming the horses. His son spent 20 hours per week attending to the horses. Taxpayer and his wife hired experienced trainers, and did whatever they could to reduce expenses and make their horses marketable for sale, stud fees, etc. They devoted far more time to the activity than they would have if they merely derived pleasure from horses. </li> <li> taxpayer, an author, was actively involved in the writing business for 60 years. While he worked full-time for a newspaper, his sideline book-writing also rose to the level of a trade or business. He made $10,000 in royalties in earlier years, and the expenses generating the loss at issue eventually led to the sale of a book for $35,000. While he derived pleasure from writing, it was also clearly his livelihood. </li> <li> taxpayer, a full-time artist, devoted most of her time to producing artwork and improving her skills. Because of her efforts to promote her artwork, taxpayer's works were in numerous exhibitions at museums and art galleries over a ten-year period. She (1) had one-person exhibitions at nine galleries, (2) had her work displayed at eleven public and private collections, and (3) had her art exhibited with at least ten financially-successful artists. </li> <li> taxpayer was able to arrange his work schedule so that he spent only 26 weeks a year on his electrical contractor job and so was free to operate his commercial fishing boat. Because of this work arrangement, taxpayer was able to fish 17 of the 19 halibut openings (i.e., a limited period when fishing's permitted by law) during a five-year period and spent an additional 53 days at sea fishing for black cod during three of those five years. In addition, taxpayer devoted a considerable amount of time to gear repair and maintenance, boat maintenance, developing cost saving devices and researching different fishing techniques and fishing locations. </li> <li> taxpayer, a commercial pilot, devoted all of his free time to his farm. Taxpayer didn't hire part-time help to assist him while he was flying; rather, he structured his flight time to accomplish as much as possible when he was on his farm. Furthermore, after taxpayer retired, he planned to operate the farm on a full-time basis. </li> <li> taxpayer, an attorney who was a sole practitioner in her own law office, devoted substantial time and effort in carrying on the activity. She worked full-time in the law practice, and maintained normal office hours. The taxpayer also spent considerable amounts of time at professional seminars, bar association meetings and civic functions, all of which were intended to increase her professional exposure and to generate new clients. Although the taxpayer spent less time in her office during the tax year that her father grew ill and then died, this didn't demonstrate a lack of a profit objective. </li> <li> taxpayer devoted two hours a day to his tutoring business. Because of a disability, he was unable to devote more time to the business. </li> <li> taxpayer spent considerable time on a gold mining and treasure-hunting activity. He wasn't merely an investor who made occasional inquiry into the operations. He participated in daily operations, negotiated contracts, arranged equipment rentals, and personally transported equipment. In connection with one operation, he spent 5-6 weeks working long hours, watching pumping equipment during a Texas summer. These weren't activities that provided personal pleasure or recreation. </li> <li> taxpayer, a teacher with coaching duties, spent up to 30 hours a week and over 30 travel days a year on private coaching activities. His marriage and personal life suffered. Although he had a steady stream of losses from the activity with only one year of nominal profit, the trend was towards more income, reduced expenses, and more profit potential. His teaching provided a modest income, so the coaching expenses weren't intended to produce tax benefits. The Tax Court found it difficult to label the teaching and coaching a hobby, despite the elements of personal pleasure, because these the activities had always been taxpayer's personal and professional pursuits. </li> </ul> </div>\n\n<div>The fact that the taxpayer, a harpoon fisherman, made only 15 and 12 fishing trips each year didn't indicate that he didn't have a profit motive. The taxpayer testified that there were only 15 to 20 days during the season when fishing was worthwhile.</div>\n\n<div>On the other hand, although the taxpayer spends considerable time attending to an activity, hard work alone doesn't establish a profit motive where the taxpayer derives substantial personal enjoyment from the activity. </div>\n\n<div>A profit motive wasn't indicated: <ul> <li> in taxpayer's cattle-raising operations, although the husband spent four hours each weekday, plus eight hours daily over the weekend, and the wife spent five-to-six hours each day on cattle-related activities. They didn't work in a business-like manner. The miscellaneous and disorganized financial records presented didn't show that taxpayers expected a profit. </li> <li> where taxpayer went to his cattle ranch only 15 to 17 times a year, spending three to four days per visit, and didn't offer evidence of the hours of labor expended while there or of having hired anyone to run the ranching operations. </li> <li> when the total time taxpayer spent exploring whether the investment (involving his cash investment of $45,000 and indebtedness of $190,000) was a “good deal” amounted to one short phone call. </li> <li> where the taxpayers, who both had full-time jobs, spent only six to eight hours per year for each time-share unit preparing to rent each unit out. </li> <li> where taxpayer-wife (W) devoted considerable time and effort to taxpayers' horse-related activities (showing and breeding “cutting horses”), including manual labor such as cleaning stables, and attending horse shows most weekends, but the activity had recreational aspects for W who had a demonstrated, long-term (since the age of 14) interest in horses. W's time and effort wasn't so extensive as to be only classifiable as profit-oriented, as taxpayers argued. In fact, a part of W's attendance at the shows was to compete on a horse in which taxpayers didn't retain any possibility of profit. And the unpleasant tasks associated with caring for horses are required regardless of whether the activity pursued as a hobby or business. </li> <li> where a taxpayer, without any experience in horsebreeding or any attempt to gain expertise in the area, bought a mare after discussions with the mare's owner about financial advantages of breeding it. Taxpayer didn't attend any seminars or subscribe to any magazines on horsebreeding. After five years, the only income that taxpayer had was from a sale of one foal and insurance money received on the death of a second foal. Taxpayer didn't maintain any business records or books. Taxpayer also didn't leave his full time job at Southern Bell to spend more time and effort in his horsebreeding activity. </li> <li> where the taxpayers, who engaged in an embryo transplant cattle and miniature horse breeding activity, had little time to devote to the activity. The husband worked full time, including Saturday and Sunday mornings at his veterinary clinic, in addition to being on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while the wife had little time for the activity because of her involvement in ongoing public relations campaigns (including a campaign for the husband's clinic) and in other activities of various organizations. </li> <li> where the taxpayer failed to show he spent significant time or effort in conducting his computer consulting business during the year at issue. The taxpayer had established the business after being laid off from his full-time engineering job. But he was again employed full-time as an engineer during the year at issue. The taxpayer conceded that the long hours he worked at that job—between 45 and 55 hours per week—precluded him from providing any consulting services that year. In addition, he spent significant amount of time at home with his family, and also took engineering classes. </li> <li> where the taxpayer, the general partner and promoter of a limited partnership that was formed to conduct oil and gas drilling activities, greatly increased his participation in the activities of the limited partnership shortly after IRS began to investigate it. For the first time, taxpayer began to visit drilling sites and entered into drilling agreements on the partnership's behalf at various previously undeveloped sites. Taxpayer didn't have a profit objective with respect to the partnership during the period before IRS began its audit. </li> <li> where the taxpayer's mother spent most of her time working at the taxpayer's pet store. Although the Second Circuit, in vacating and remanding a Tax Court decision, held that the mother's time had to be taken into account, the Tax Court on remand held that the taxpayer operated the store regardless of its profitability to keep his mother occupied. </li> <li> in taxpayers' organic beef farming activity, where the taxpayers (H and W) were unable to devote the time necessary to successfully conduct the activity as a result of H's outside commitments to other business activities, and the demands placed on W in raising four children. It was only after several consecutive years in which the farm lost money that the taxpayers realized that W couldn't operate the farm profitably without H's assistance. But three more years passed before H withdrew from his other interests and began to devote more time to the farm. The Tax Court characterized the taxpayers “lack of commitment” to the activity as being determinative of a lack of profit objective. </li> <li> in taxpayers' horse-boarding venture, where their own activities didn't go beyond what would be necessary to care for their own horses. When taxpayers moved to the farm at issue, they saved themselves the cost of boarding their own horses elsewhere and had greater access to the horses for their daughters, who were prize-winning equestrians. Most of the work, primarily cleaning stables, was done by the taxpayer-wife, and by other family members in exchange for meals. The fact that taxpayers' clients—the paying boarders—each assumed the responsibility of feeding, cleaning, grooming and providing medical services to their own horses undercut the taxpayers' claim that they were involved in boarding horses for profit. </li> <li> although taxpayers spent enough time in their apple orchard to grow 40,000 pounds of apples, taxpayer (husband) did all the picking himself and didn't pick all the apples. So, he didn't make enough effort to profit from the time spent. </li> <li> Where taxpayer, an attorney who operated two law offices, spent only an estimated one day a month on his apple and timber farming activities, and didn't engage any full-time employees in the activities. Although taxpayer generally went to the farm each week on Thursday and left on Saturday or Sunday, he maintained a second (vacation) home on the property, and expended only minimal time and effort on the farm activity. </li> <li> where taxpayers (H and W), in connection with their activity of selling model railroad merchandise at model railroad shows, collected only $1,100, $5,300, and $13,00 in gross receipts for the three years at issue, and attended only 4, 13, and 24 shows respectively in each of those years. This showed that taxpayers didn't devote much of their personal time and effort to the activity, which helped convince the Tax Court that the activity wasn't conducted with a profit motive. </li> <li> where taxpayer, a full-time quality engineer, who also engaged in a music activity, claimed he rehearsed 8 to 10 hours per week with his church's choir, with whom he performed, and an additional 5 to 6 hours per week by himself in his home studio, but the court didn't believe he devoted that much time to being a musician given that he had a full-time job, also operated a sales business, provided personal care to his fatally ill wife, and raised his children during the years in issue. </li> <li> where taxpayer spent approximately 100 to 300 hours in one year on his stock car racing activity, and held a full-time job at the same time, never missing a day of work. </li> <li> where taxpayer participated in his bed and breakfast activity only when he wasn't at his full-time job as an elementary school principal. Taxpayer had early morning meetings and after-school activities in addition to his official eight-hour workday, and was required to work 11 months of the year. Taxpayer also claimed to be engaged in a woodworking business. The minimal time and effort that taxpayer spent on the bed and breakfast activity indicated he lacked a profit objective for it. </li> <li> taxpayer spent 20 to 30 hours a week on airplanes—time he claimed was related to his aviation maintenance activities. But he didn't establish how much of that time was for clients, as opposed to work on his own Cessna for recreational purposes. </li> <li> where taxpayer spent between 2,100 and 2,800 hours per year on collecting and selling science fiction memorabilia, but even in her most profitable years, her income worked out to roughly only 30 cents an hour. Her consistent losses and the substantial enjoyment she derived indicated the activity was a hobby and not a business. </li> <li> where there was no evidence in the record to show the amount of time taxpayer spent on his Mars exploration research and taxpayer had multiple jobs and was working on a space architecture degree during the tax year at issue. The only evidence as to taxpayer's time and effort during the tax year at issue was that he travelled to two conferences. But he wasn't a presenter at either conference. He only attended for informational purposes. </li> </ul> </div>",

        "text": "<div>Although a reasonable expectation of profit is not required for purposes of the hobby loss rules (see ¶  M-5801 ), the facts and circumstances (without regard to the taxpayer's subjective intent) must indicate that the taxpayer entered the activity, or continued the activity, with the objective of making a profit.</div>\n\n<div>IRS says that the taxpayer must have a financial and economic forecast for the activity, as demonstrated in a formal written business plan. The plan must be realistic, not a “fantasy” profit and loss statement. It must show a short and long range forecast for the activity, and allow for changes due to potential unforeseen and fortuitous circumstances. </div>\n\n<div>The Sixth Circuit held that the correct standard is whether the taxpayer entered the activity with the objective of making a profit, keeping in mind that a small chance of making a large profit can support a profit motive. It reversed a case in which the Tax Court had applied the standard of whether taxpayer had a reasonable expectation of profit. In remanding the case, it said that if the Tax Court found that the mine taxpayer had invested in included an area that would have resulted in a large recovery of gold in at short time, it should hold that the profit motive requirement was satisfied.</div>\n\n<div>The proper test is whether the taxpayer had a actual and honest profit objective when he undertook the venture, not whether he expected a profit. One may start with the sincere purpose of eventually reaping a profit but in the belief that the probability of financial success is small or even remote. That is, the taxpayer does not really expect a profit but, nonetheless, is willing to take the gamble.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >Thus, a taxpayer who engages in an activity in which there is a small chance of a large profit, such as a person who invests in a wildcat oil well or an inventor, can qualify under this standard, even though the expectation of profit might be considered unreasonable, and so can a poor person engaged in what appears to be an inefficient farming operation. Still, a vain hope that at some remote day a profit might result is not sufficient to give a farming operation the character of a business.</div>\n\n<div>The Fourth Circuit confirmed the bona fide profit motive standard when it declined to overrule a Tax Court decision denying a doctor's deductions for farming activities and held that the taxpayer failed to show that the court applied the erroneous “reasonable profit motive” standard instead of “sincere and honest” or “bona fide profit motive” standard.</div>\n\n<div>There was a bona fide profit objective, even though the expectation of profit may not have been reasonable, where: <ul> <li> a taxpayer, who inherited the farm which he operated, obtained outside employment in order to offset his farm losses and did not operate the farm at a loss to offset his other income. The court said the bleak financial picture of the farm activity was explainable more by inefficient operations than by the absence of the taxpayer's expectation of a profit. </li> <li> an artist craved personal recognition and believed that selling her work for profit represented the attainment of that recognition. </li> <li> a taxpayer invested in a soil treatment process and gave credible testimony that he believed that the process would allow him to realize a fortune. Moreover, this testimony was supported by his diligence in implementing the process. He supplied funds, bought and rented equipment, and solicited accounts and clients. </li> <li> a taxpayer devoted substantial spare time in attempting to develop materials and to market them, although he did not have any business income from the activity. </li> <li> a full-time airline flight attendant had a renewable franchise to market and distribute video cassette instruction programs for use in elementary grades of parochial schools. </li> <li> taxpayers marketed and distributed racquetball racquets under a franchise agreement. </li> <li> partnerships were formed to manufacture, sell, and distribute technology to automatically identify and monitor ingress and egress from large parking facilities. They entered into agreements with X to research and develop this project. The partnerships' expert testified that if the project had been developed as originally envisioned, it would have saved airports millions of dollars and that partnership profits would have been comparable to the partnerships' projections. The court was persuaded that had the project been successfully developed, a sales price of $3 million was reasonable. The partners were not unreasonable in relying on the information provided by X as to the project's feasibility. The court found that IRS didn't prove that the partnerships didn't have economic profit as their primary objective. </li> <li> taxpayer turned down a promotion and quit his job to devote himself to selling solar heaters. He had frequent sales appointments and held solar heater seminars in his home. </li> <li> taxpayer, who was engaged in management consulting, (1) spent more than 20 hours per week on the activity (while also employed for 40 hours per week in another activity), (2) was a member of an industry association, (3) promoted his business by direct mail, magazine advertisements and personal contacts, (4) hired a part-time secretary, (5) kept some business records, and (6) over a three-year period tried several approaches for increasing profitability. The Tax Court stated that the proper standard is whether there exists an “actual and honest objective of making a profit;” whether that objective is reasonable is not the standard, although, in determining whether the requisite profit motive exists, objective facts are given greater weight than the taxpayer's statement of intent. On the facts given, the standard was found to be satisfied, even though the activity was ultimately abandoned after it failed to return a profit after approximately four years. </li> <li> taxpayer worked hard in his attempt to achieve profitability of his three acre farm, was knowledgeable about farming, consulted with government experts, and changed his method of cultivating in an effort to improve production. Some of his difficulty in turning a profit from his farm activity was due to circumstances beyond his control, e. g. his pear trees died from rot and many of his chickens were killed by his dogs and his neighbor's tomcat. </li> </ul> </div>\n\n<div>There was no evidence of a bona fide intent to make a profit where: <ul> <li> taking into account all costs that taxpayer associated with his plant nursery business, the venture could never produce a profit. </li> <li> taxpayer rented an A-frame house that had no plumbing to traveling evangelists for little or no rent. Although he “charged” $80 per month rent, he actually collected only $20 rent for the year and incurred expenses of over $6,000. </li> <li> taxpayer developed an information management idea which included plans to build an entrepreneurial library and the promotion of his total productive employment system theory. Taxpayer failed to explain how he would raise the money to build, staff, or maintain the library, where it would be located, and whom it would serve. Taxpayer did not prove he had sufficient expertise to develop a library and did not show how much time he spent on this project. Furthermore, taxpayer had no inventory, employees, licenses to operate, separate business phones or records. </li> <li> taxpayers' leased their 80% interest in realty to a Greek Orthodox Church. Previously, the taxpayers had donated the other 20% interest to the Church and had continued to pay liabilities on that interest. Taxpayers' sole purpose in entering into the leasing arrangement with the Church was to enable it later acquire the property. There was no evidence that the taxpayers had any intent other than to help the Church. The fact that the taxpayers sold their 80% interest to the Church at a profit didn't negate the fact that their intent in buying and renting the property was to help the Church. </li> <li> an S corporation, engaged in the recycling business, leased farmland on which it maintained minimal herds of livestock and did nothing to improve the quality of its crop of organically grown almonds. During the three years at issue, the farming expenses totaled $438,663, while receipts over the farm's 6-year existence totaled $25,820. Despite expert farming and financial advice on how to increase profits, nothing was done to change the farming activity. The farm activity was continued for the purpose of using its losses to substantially reduced the income from the S corporation's highly profitable recycling business. </li> <li> after seven years of working on a manuscript, a lawyer couldn't establish that it was likely a publisher would accept it when it was finished. His self-serving testimony and the testimony of his law school professor didn't provide any way of determining the manuscript's potential profitability. </li> <li> a full-time office supervisor was also a part-time singer. </li> <li> In considering the deductibility of expenditures made by partnerships relating to their arrangement with a Brazilian company to research and develop monoclonal antibody conjugates, the Fifth Circuit said that the profit objective test to be applied was whether the facts and circumstances indicated that the taxpayers made the expenditures “primarily in furtherance of a bona fide profit objective independent of tax consequences.” (If so, the deductions attributable to the arrangement would be allowed.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed the Tax Court and denied the deductions because the partnerships had purchased the research projects with the primary intent of realizing tax advantages. </li> <li> In a case appealable to the Fifth Circuit, the test applied by the Tax Court to determine whether partnerships formed to engage in a research and development project had a profit objective under Code Sec. 183 , was whether the partnerships had a “primary” objective of making a profit. The Tax Court so ruled because it found that was the test of the Fifth Circuit as stated in Agro Science, (footnote 4). But the Tax Court found that the Fifth Circuit's test was in conflict with the test applied by the Tax Court in the context of Code Sec. 183 . The Tax Court said that its test for determining profit objective focuses “on the economic viability of the transaction[s] and on the actual and honest nature of the [partnerships'] profit objective.” </li> </ul> <strong><div class='ria'>RIA observation:</strong> The Fifth Circuit's opinion in Agro Science (footnote 4) affirmed the Tax Court's decision in that case without indicating that the Fifth Circuit was applying a different profit objective test than the one applied by the Tax Court. It appears that the Fifth Circuit was not aware that it was stating a test in Agro Science which differed from the Tax Court's test. <ul> <li> taxpayer bought a share of a refrigerated container to produce rental income without adequately investigating the feasibility of the plan or the value of the container. Taxpayer had no background in the business, exhibited no interest in following up on his investment, and never had control over the container. The court did not find it credible that in a year in which his income was just $35,000, taxpayer would invest $26,000 to generate a unknown amount of future income. The court concluded taxpayer was motivated by the potential tax benefits the plan offered and not a profit potential. </li> <li> taxpayer, who worked full time, was engaged in drag racing approximately two weekends per month. He testified that any profit from his racing activity would result from the accumulation of “national points” in regional and national “points meets.” Taxpayer failed to adequately explain what a “points meet” was, or what was required to qualify for a national meet. In addition, the Court said that his testimony, that he spent two weekends per month at the race track, was exaggerated. </li> <li> taxpayer, a successful business executive in the garment industry, entered into a professional golfer/sponsor agreement with his son, who had lost his enthusiasm for the garment industry business and, after winning a tournament at a local golf club, felt that because professional golf was undergoing a substantial increase in growth and popularity, it was a good time to make a career change and become a golf professional. Taxpayer failed to make a financial analysis of the sponsorship as a profit-seeking venture or make any attempt to calculate when there might be a return on his sponsorship investment. Taxpayer did not enter into the sponsorship agreement with an honest objective of making a profit, but rather to give his son the opportunity to make a career change and become a professional golfer. The financial support that taxpayer gave to his son under the sponsorship agreement was no different than that of any parent who decides to help a child financially with educational expenses or with expenses for other career-seeking endeavors.</div> </li> </ul> </div>",

        "text": "<div>For purposes of the “hobby loss rule,” which disallows deductions attributable to activities not engaged in for profit except as specifically provided under the Code, whether an activity is a hobby or is engaged in for profit is determined by taking into account certain objective factors, see ¶  M-5800 et seq.</div>\n\n<div>Owning a farm and engaging in farm-related activities, such as horse-breeding, raising show horses, etc., aren't activities engaged in for profit where: (1) there's no evidence of business-like conduct of the operation; (2) there's a long history of losses for the farm or farm-related activity; (3) the farm is the taxpayer's residence; and (4) there's significant recreational use of the location.</div>\n\n<div>The Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded a Tax Court decision that disallowed taxpayers' deductions based on the Tax Court's finding that taxpayers' dominant motive with respect to their horse breeding activity was to produce tax savings rather than to make a profit. The Ninth Circuit will uphold the Tax Court's finding of a dominant non-profit motive only if the record reflects that the motive imputed by the Tax Court makes sense. To support a finding of such a dominant motive, the record must reflect that the tax savings the taxpayers expected to gain as a result of their horse breeding activity could be greater than the real economic losses the taxpayers might reasonably have expected to incur. So, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the Tax Court for a determination whether taxpayers' horse breeding activity realistically could have been expected to result in tax savings greater than the economic losses that might reasonably have been anticipated. Factors considered by the Tax Court in making its determination of a non-profit tax savings motive included the fact that taxpayers had minimal experience and training in horse breeding and incurred excessive monthly rental payments. </div>\n\n<div>In the following situations, horse operations weren't engaged in for profit: <ul> <li> Taxpayer, a full-time sales representative, failed to devise or follow an operating plan for his Arabian horse breeding activity. It was unclear whether taxpayer intended to create a breeding herd or show horses, or to train or teach in the field. </li> <li> The only activities of taxpayer's ranch during the years at issue were the feeding, care, and training of one to three horses and the training of taxpayer's children to enter 4-H horse shows. The 4-H program rules prohibited the parent from being in the business of raising, showing, breeding, or training horses for third persons for compensation. When the taxpayer's children became too old to participate in 4-H activities, the ranching ended. </li> <li> Taxpayers' only daughter excelled at riding horses, and their horse breeding activity didn't make a profit in any of its nine years of operation. Taxpayers didn't change their methods of operation to try to make the enterprise profitable. </li> <li> Taxpayer claimed substantial losses over a ten-year period from a wholly-owned S corporation engaged in farming. Amounts spent for breeding animals were small compared to the amounts spent for driveways and landscaping. The taxpayer's personal use of the horses appeared to override any decision to engage in a horse-breeding activity. </li> <li> Taxpayer couldn't make a profit from breeding Arabian horses because she reduced her holdings of productive mares, she had little expertise in breeding, didn't use records to improve operations, did little advertising, and her husband had a large income against which she could offset losses. </li> <li> Taxpayer testified that she raised horses for profit, not for fun, that she advertised her horses for sale in magazines and horse related publications and that she had sold seven horses for an average price of $2,000. The activity wasn't conducted in a business-like manner. No evidence was presented of when the horses were bought and sold nor of the timing and amount of expenses for feed and other items needed for horse breeding. </li> <li> Taxpayer attempted to establish an endurance horse breeding and training facility. After five years, neither of his two mares had been bred, and the operation earned no income. Taxpayer earned a substantial income working full-time in the insurance business. His spare time was divided between his endurance horse activities and his involvement with vintage automobiles. The court found that taxpayer's personal enjoyment was the motivation for his attempts to establish the horse ranch. </li> <li> Taxpayer sustained annual losses in his horse breeding and racing activity for 20 years without attempting to increase profitability. He failed to introduce cost-cutting measures or change the manner of conducting the activity in response to years of mounting losses. </li> <li> Taxpayers engaged in paso fino horse breeding activity for 11 years without ever coming close to making a profit. Taxpayers' books and records (which didn't include any financial statements, profit and loss projections, budgets, breakeven analyses, or marketing surveys) weren't used to implement cost-saving measures or to improve profitability, but only to substantiate expenses claimed on their returns. While in theory taxpayers could have turned a profit had they hit the lottery with a million-dollar horse, the taxpayers' prospect for doing so with their existing horses was negligible. </li> <li> Taxpayer, an airline pilot, could afford to operate his horse breeding activity as a hobby. Although he had been involved with horses since childhood, studied breeding operations and bloodlines, read books and journals on the subject matter, and took a short university course on equine reproduction, he never consulted any horse breeders about the best way to minimize expenses or to operate a profitable business, and started the activity with no concept of what his ultimate costs might be or how he might achieve any degree of cost efficiency. In an 11-year period, he incurred net losses of from $92,210 to $154,365. Moreover, he didn't keep adequate records, commingled the financial affairs of the horse breeding activity with his personal finances, didn't make any written forecasts or projections of future income and failed to formulate a credible business or profit plan. He spent a significant amount of time on the activity, but that was due to his fondness for horses rather than an expectation of profit. </li> <li> Taxpayer, a plastic surgeon who was heavily involved in polo and equestrian activities, had losses operating a horse ranch for several years and had no realistic possibility of making a profit. </li> <li> Taxpayer sustained increasing losses over a six-year period from his Percheron draft horse breeding activity, but made no attempt to change his operation. He kept no income statements and no profit or business plans. Although he lacked expertise in the breeding and raising of Percheron horses, he didn't study the profit potential of raising them, seek out competent and experienced partners, nor consult books or persons operating profitable businesses in the breeding of Percheron horses. There was no established market for the horses, and prices received on their sale were low compared to the costs of producing them. </li> <li> Taxpayers engaged in horse racing and breeding activities for at least 16 years, losing more than $465,000 without coming near a profit. They initiated their activity without developing a business plan, and throughout those years of continuous losses didn't materially alter their mode of operation. While they didn't ride their horses or make them available for others to ride, they did attend races at the track, watch their horses race, and gamble on the races. The enjoyment taxpayers got from being engaged in horse racing and breeding was the most significant reason they continued to engage in the activity despite their record of consistent losses. </li> <li> Taxpayer, a doctor, failed to show that breeding, training and showing his Arabian horses had the primary objective of making a profit. He had a long and consistent history of losses (1986 through 1997) that wasn't due to either a depressed market or the death or infertility of several horses. Expenditures he made during a period of market decline (refurbishing his house, building a lake, garage, exercise facility, barn stalls, and run-in sheds) were inconsistent with his assertion that circumstances beyond his control contributed to his losses. Nor could the losses, as the taxpayer argued, be attributed to the startup phase of his horse-breeding activity (i.e., the first 5 to 10 years) because the taxpayer had been breeding Arabian horses since 1976. The taxpayer didn't conduct this activity in a businesslike manner. He never developed a business plan or detailed break-even analysis, and never consulted with experts on the financial aspects of his horse activities. While he maintained separate checking accounts for his personal and horse-related activities, he would on occasion ignore this division. In addition, he paid his friend who lived with him 40% to 50% commissions on horse sales, when the normal rate was 10% to 15%. </li> <li> Taxpayer, a successful full-time dentist, didn't engage in an activity of breeding and showing Arabian horses for profit. Over a 16-year period, she never owned more than eight horses, of which five were produced by her breeding activities. She sold only one horse during that period, and retained all her other horses regardless of the ability to breed or their desirability as breeding stock. Moreover, that single sale produced her only profitable year, and the profit for that year was only $209. Other factors that showed that she didn't conduct the activity for profit were her failure to conduct the activity in a businesslike manner, including her failure to undertake any actions to improve its profitability, the lack of expertise of both taxpayer and her advisors in the business of horse breeding, her substantial income from her dental practice, and the fact that she rode her horses for pleasure. </li> <li> Taxpayer, the sole shareholder of a corporation engaged in horse rental, breeding, showing and riding lessons, operated this activity in an unbusinesslike manner. While the horse activity had the “trappings” of business carried on for profit (e.g., books and records kept by a certified public accountant (CPA), a separate bank account, advertising, and significant time and effort expended by the taxpayer), the taxpayer didn't use his records to improve operations, and, despite mounting losses, failed to make changes to increase profits. Although the taxpayer was knowledgeable about horses, he lacked the business expertise to make the farm profitable and failed to seek professional advice. Losses as a result of several horse injuries and the expected work for the horses in a television show never materializing weren't beyond the taxpayer's control where the taxpayer didn't show that the horse activity would have been profitable had the horses not suffered these injuries, and the taxpayer didn't actively seek any other television or film work. In addition, substantial income from regular employment allowed the taxpayer to continue operating the horse activity despite heavy losses. </li> <li> Taxpayer acquired horses for his daughter's riding pleasure. Taxpayer remained fully occupied with his dental practice and made no effort to be involved in horse show activities. </li> <li> Taxpayers' focus of their horse breeding and training activity was to “nurture” their son's goal of becoming a world-class rider. Taxpayers stated that their son's goal could only be achieved by hiring and consulting with experts in the horse field. Taxpayers took pleasure from the activity, both from watching their son develop into a horseman and from the reputation they hoped to acquire in the community as a result of their association with the horses, riders, and trainers. </li> <li> Taxpayer offered little evidence that his horse breeding and racing activity was engaged in for any reason other than as an outlet for his love of horses. During the four tax years in issue, taxpayer didn't try to improve profitability by devising new methods of operations. Taxpayer was granted a horse racing license by the states of California and Arizona, but such a license was necessary whether the horse racing activity was conducted as a hobby or as a business. </li> <li> Taxpayer, although dedicated to her horse breeding activity, was primarily motivated by her love of horses, which dated back to her childhood. Taxpayer had no training or experience in the horse breeding/training business, made no studies or consultations with professionals about the activity's business aspects, didn't maintain a separate bank account or formal books and records, and didn't make any effort to change the direction of her operation (which incurred eight years of losses), although she recognized her need to do so. </li> <li> Taxpayer testified that he had enjoyed working with horses since his childhood, and also admitted that his children sometimes rode the horses used in his horse breeding and training activity. Taxpayer failed to produce adequate business records to corroborate his claims about the time that he spent in the activity, the number of his customers, or the presence of a business plan. </li> <li> Taxpayers, husband and wife, operated a horse farm for pleasure. The wife, an accomplished rider, performed at shows and was responsible for most of the farm activities, while her husband earned substantial income as a medical doctor. </li> <li> Taxpayer-wife's recreational objectives in breeding and showing “cutting horses” were a significant component of the taxpayers' horse-related activity, which generated substantial losses (averaging $40,000 a year for the last seven years) for 23 of the 26 years of the activity. She had actively pursued an interest in horses since the age of 14, riding in competitions in high school and college. Taxpayer-husband had substantial annual income (over $90,000 in each of the last seven years) and deduction of the losses significantly reduced the after-tax cost of his wife's activity. Additional evidence of the personal component to the activity was taxpayer's purchase of the horse his wife had ridden in high school, and an essentially noneconomic transaction in which they bought and sold back a horse for a nominal price to provide the wife with a mount to ride in nonprofessional cutting horse competitions while their prize stallion was being ridden in professional competition by a trainer. </li> <li> Taxpayers, husband and wife who engaged in Arabian horse racing, breeding, and sales, operated these activities in a nonbusinesslike manner, and derived personal pleasure from their work with horses. Factors indicating their lack of profit motive included: their lack of expertise, their history of significant losses, their failure to take actions to make their activity profitable, their ability to use the activity's losses to avoid paying income and self-employment taxes in four of the five years in issue, and the unlikelihood of asset appreciation. </li> <li> Taxpayer raised only one horse during the three years in issue, and that horse never produced any revenue. The horse was unable to race because it injured its leg and, although the horse went on to win about 20 ribbons in hunter/jumper shows, it never won any money. The taxpayer couldn't show any profit objective in raising and training the horse for resale. Because the horse had been neutered, its resale value was limited. Taxpayer's five-year plan showed an overall loss. </li> <li> Taxpayer (1) was involved with horses her whole life, expressed pride in the trophies won by her horses and referred to her horses as “her babies,” (2) kept no formal accounting records and commingled those records that she did keep with her personal records, (3) didn't maintain a separate bank account for the horse activity, (4) sustained substantial, consistent and generally increasing losses for the entire ten-year period during which she engaged in the activity, and (5) financed her horse activities with substantial income that she had from unrelated passive sources. </li> <li> Taxpayer, a self-employed chiropractor, incurred $388,106 in losses from his Arabian horse-breeding activity during a seven-year period. Even though he managed to turn his chiropractic clinic into a successful operation after incurring losses during the early years of his business, the Tax Court wasn't convinced that the skills needed to run a successful clinic applied to operating a profitable horse farm. Further, taxpayer didn't operate the activity in a businesslike manner. Although he registered his horse-breeding activity and filed the appropriate employment tax returns, taxpayer didn't have an organized system for determining the profitability of each horse. Further, even though he promoted the activity through advertising and the showing of his horses, the promotion wasn't successful, and he didn't change his methods to attempt to improve his success rate. Moreover, there were no income records, and the only expense records offered into evidence were canceled checks. </li> <li> Taxpayers began their horse-breeding operations with no expertise in running a profitable ranch, nor any detailed written plan fashioned to enable them to earn a profit. The operations produced only ever-increasing expenses and losses; the few actual sales they made gave no promise of recouping the considerable losses they incurred. Indeed, selling their entire stock for its fair market value wouldn't have compensated them for those losses. Moreover, taxpayers' testimony about actions to reduce their losses and increase their income from the horse-breeding operations was vague and self-serving. Finally, taxpayers' income from other sources was adequate to support a comfortable standard of living even after taking into account the money spent on the horse-breeding operations, and their interest in horse-breeding was prompted by their daughter's love for horses. These factors outweighed the businesslike character of their books and records, and the hard, often unpleasant, work that taxpayers performed in connection with the operation. </li> <li> Taxpayer (1) incurred seven consecutive years of losses in horse breeding and equestrian training activity, (2) didn't keep a separate bank account for the activity, (3) kept invoices, checks and receipts, but no other records of the activity, (4) had some knowledge of training a horse for dressage and low-level jumping but had no formal training in horse training or breeding, (5) took no steps to increase his knowledge or to consult experts during the years at issue, (6) bought a gelding and bred another horse knowing that any male offspring would probably have to be gelded (so risking having horses with no breeding or performing value should they suffer training injuries), (7) bought a horse without knowing that it wasn't suitable for performing, (8) had taxable income from other sources during the years at issue sufficient to maintain a comfortable standard of living notwithstanding the horse activity losses, (9) engaged in horse exercise, riding and maintenance for 15 to 18 hours a week, but not significant actual horse training and (10) devoted an average of 58 hours a week to his professional practice as a psychologist. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the Tax Court's conclusion that the taxpayer's horse training and breeding activity wasn't engaged in for profit, but noted that it was a “close question” and based its affirmance on the clearly-erroneous standard (which applies to a circuit court's ability to substitute its factual findings for the factual findings of the Tax Court, see ¶  U-5104 .) </li> <li> Taxpayer, a successful attorney who operated a horse farm, kept no records showing the expenditures made with respect to each individual horse. Without that knowledge, he had no way of knowing which of his broodmares was producing more profitable foals or which training regimen was successful at increasing the value of the horses. Nor did he separate the expenses incurred from his horse-breeding activity from the expenses incurred from raising steers. Although taxpayer and his family spent significant amounts of time and effort carrying on the horse-breeding activity, taxpayer and his daughter were avid riders and derived substantial recreational benefit from the time they spent with the horses. </li> <li> Taxpayers, husband and wife, failed to establish that they had a business plan for generating a profit from roping horse activity; hadn't consulted with professionals as to how to make the activity profitable; and failed to show that they changed operation of the roping horse activity to generate a profit or that they hired any individual with the expertise and experience necessary to make that activity profitable. In addition, the deductions attributable to the roping horse activity far exceeded the income that was derived from that activity, and the nature of the tasks and amount of time that the husband spent in the roping horse activity was consistent with his lifetime enjoyment of horses. </li> <li> Taxpayers didn't prepare a business plan, didn't refer to their horse-related financial records to monitor expenses, had no separate bank account for the horse-related activities, didn't show an expectation that their horses would appreciate in value, had never had a profitable year with their horse-related activities, derived tax benefits from their claimed losses due to income from other sources, and enjoyed horses. The Tax Court cited the taxpayers' long history of working with horses in determining that there was an element of personal pleasure in their horse-related activities inconsistent with a profit motive. The taxpayers had excellent credentials for horse breeding, training, and racing, but it wasn't clear whether they had experience or sought advice with respect to the financial aspects of operating a horse business. </li> <li> Taxpayer sustained losses on his horse breeding and racing activities for 37 straight years and didn't change his manner of conducting the activity to improve profitability. Although the taxpayer took steps to increase his expertise on horses, and used professional trainers to raise his horses, he did nothing to increase his knowledge of successful business and economic practices with respect to breeding and racing horses and didn't seek advice on the economic aspects of his horse-related activities. The taxpayer had a separate bank account and kept detailed financial breeding records, but didn't have budgets, income statements, balance sheets, income projections, or financial statements for the activity (other than those compiled by his accountant to prepare tax returns). Finally, the taxpayer had substantial other income against which to offset his losses from horse-related activities. </li> <li> Taxpayers sustained losses on their horse breeding activities for the 16 years in which they were engaged in those activities, didn't have a written business plan, had no more than vague plans to make the business profitable, didn't consult with experts on how to make their operations profitable, and had substantial income from other sources against which to offset the losses from the horse breeding activities. These factors outweighed the facts that taxpayers acquired expertise in breeding and raising horses, and spent a significant amount of time and effort on the activities, and convinced the court that the activities weren't engaged in for profit. </li> <li> Taxpayer argued his profit motive from his cutting horse activity was based on the goal of having one of his horses become a triple crown winner, but the likelihood of that was small. He had no business records for the activity, spent only 8 to 10 hours a week on it, and incurred losses of $568,000 offset by only minimal gains on individual sales (under $1,000) and no profitable periods. He had substantial income from his other pursuits, but no history of success in horse-related activities, which provided recreational benefits—he conceded he derived personal enjoyment from the activity. </li> <li> Taxpayers submitted no books and records with projected profit and loss (P/L), balance sheets, or budgets. Inventory lists were incomplete and full of errors, showing horses that were no longer living or no longer owned. Taxpayers claimed they offered numerous services that a hobbyist farm wouldn't offer such as breeding services, horse sales and leasing, and riding lessons, but none of those generated any income. Taxpayers spent very little on advertising ($1,120) compared to their overall expenses of over $200,000, and didn't seek professional advice on the business aspects of running a profitable horse business. They presented evidence that they were considered “top breeders,” but this didn't show that they had business expertise. Taxpayers, who derived substantial personal pleasure from the activities, never showed a profit in 20 years, while their income from other sources ranged from $1 million to $2.5 million during the years at issue. </li> <li> Taxpayer's equine-related activities lacked a profit motive in 2009. She owned no horse in 2009 and in the preceding 10 years only one which she unsuccessfully tried to breed, and she competed in no horse shows. Her receipts from the activities from 2004–2009 were $588, compared to expenses of $155,244. </li> <li> Taxpayers' horse farm lost money every year but one of the 16 years in the court record. Losses were approximately $130,000 to $170,000 a year, and the farm made only $1,500 in the profitable year. Taxpayers didn't keep adequate records (see ¶  M-5834 ), didn't reform a contract with its sole employee that all but ensured they wouldn't make a reasonable profit (see ¶  M-5850 ), and didn't employ an expert in the horse-breeding business (see ¶  M-5855 ). The relatively large size of the horse farm (30 horses) wasn't dispositive that the activity was a trade or business. </li> </ul> </div>\n\n<div class='match' >In the following situations, horse operations were engaged in for profit: <ul> <li> A taxpayer was able to demonstrate that personal pleasure and recreation in operating a Morgan horse farm wasn't a significant motive where (1) he didn't live at the farm for the first ten years of its operation, (2) there were no recreational facilities there, (3) a back injury prevented him from riding horses, and (4) his wife and children rode horses infrequently. </li> <li> Taxpayers' participation in horse breeding activities wasn't driven by pleasure alone and had a profit motive where taxpayers: (1) spent six or seven years learning about horse breeding and management before attempting to engage in the activity; (2) developed a comprehensive written business plan; (3) managed and worked diligently and daily on the horse activity; (4) consulted expert horsemen and hired expert horse trainers; (5) made adjustments in their business plan; (6) maintained reasonably good books and records of income and expenses relating to the activity; and (7) after nine years, terminated their unprofitable horse activity in light of the losses realized. </li> <li> A successful businessman who began his Arabian horse breeding activity as a means of generating income for his retirement proved his profit objective where he kept complete and accurate records, advertised extensively, prepared a promotional video, exhibited the horses at shows, consulted experts, did the grooming, worming, vaccinating and other day-to-day tasks, and ran the operation in a conservative manner that emphasized minimizing expenses. </li> <li> A dentist, who began his Arabian horse breeding activity to provide a retirement plan, carried on this activity in a businesslike manner: he kept books and records (including a general ledger and separate bank account for this activity, and breeding, pedigree and health records) and had a business plan (which he modified in order to reduce expenses and increase profits). He consulted with other horse breeders and educated himself about horse breeding, equine health care, and farm management. He attended horse shows to learn about this business, hired professional trainers, and advertised his horses for sale. The taxpayer spent substantial time and effort in the horse breeding activity and derived little personal pleasure from the activity. Losses sustained by the taxpayer were during the startup phase of the activity and were the result of unforeseen circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control (a decline in the horse market and the death of several horses). </li> <li> Taxpayers bought four Appaloosa horses for pleasure, and the next year they decided to go into the horse business and other related farm activities. They performed substantially all of the labor, each working at least 40 hours per week in farming activities. The taxpayers stopped turkey and geese breeding operations when these activities failed to make a profit. They kept accurate records, worked to develop expertise in the field, and consulted experts. Moreover, the taxpayers' income from other sources, when compared with losses generated from the farm, was modest. The court concluded that the activity wasn't conducted for personal pleasure or recreation because none of the horses were used for recreational riding, and the farm required a great deal of hard work. </li> <li> Taxpayers used experienced advisors before investing in breeding horses and before making critical decisions and hired qualified persons to oversee the day-to-day operations. There didn't appear to be a personal or recreational element in the taxpayers' activities because they didn't ride horses. Although their daughters did ride, the taxpayers kept separate horses for their use. The segregation of business and personal aspects was also shown in the taxpayers' recordkeeping, e.g., they paid boarding fees for their breeding horses and their “pleasure” horses with separate checks. </li> <li> Taxpayers engaged in the training and breeding of paint horses for profit where: taxpayers kept business-like records, taxpayers had earlier engaged in and given up the training and breeding of Arabian horses because it was unprofitable; taxpayers consulted with experts in setting up the activity, and hired experts to conduct the actual training and breeding activities; taxpayers had only a modest income from other sources; taxpayers honestly and actually believed that success in the activity would produce substantial earnings and profits, and an expert confirmed that one of their three horses had real potential for success; taxpayers and their family didn't ride the horses for pleasure. </li> <li> Taxpayers operated their horse breeding and boarding activity in a serious, organized, and business-like manner. Though IRS contended that their records were inadequate because they weren't kept for each horse, the taxpayers could generate complete and accurate records and reports on individual horses from their personal computer. The taxpayers had a business plan and pursued it consistently, even if the plan wasn't written. They improved and expanded their facilities and boarded horses while beginning to acquire quality broodmares. And while they paid most of the expenses for their horse activity with personal funds, it was reasonable for a new activity, with very little cash flow, to do so. Further, losses due to the death of a mare and foal (a 25% loss in the taxpayers' breeding capability) was an unforeseen circumstances beyond the taxpayers' control that didn't show that the horse activity wasn't engaged in for profit. </li> <li> Taxpayer engaged in horse breeding and racing for profit where he: didn't receive any pleasure from racing and breeding horses; consulted and relied on experts; and changed his business plan by shifting a prospective race horse to use in breeding when it became injured. </li> <li> An orthodontist who started a horse breeding farm in preparation for his retirement from dental practice conducted the activity in a business-like manner. He consulted with professionals in the field before starting-up, bought a ranch away from his own home, built proper facilities, spent 35 to 40 hours per week on these activities, and kept complete and accurate records. Although he had operating losses, these were offset, at least in part, by unrealized increases in the value of the ranch and the horses on the ranch. The taxpayer didn't engage in these activities for personal pleasure because he and his wife had no affection for horses. Their activities (including attending horse shows) were only for business, not social purposes. The court concluded that the taxpayer wouldn't likely embark on a hobby costing thousands of dollars and much personal physical labor without a profit motive. </li> <li> Taxpayer engaged in horse breeding and racing for ten years. None of the 40 horses owned were ever bred or used for pleasure riding. The Tax Court found it unlikely that a person would expend substantial amounts of funds to buy and breed so many horses for a hobby or tax benefit in which no pleasure was derived. Also, if the horse operation didn't have a profit objective, the taxpayer wouldn't have abandoned it. </li> <li> Taxpayer operated a steeplechase training and racing stable that primarily made money by racing its horses to win purses. The taxpayer carried on her steeplechase activity in a businesslike manner, maintained complete and accurate books and records, had expertise in steeplechase training and racing, employed competent help and engaged expert consultants. The taxpayer personally performed time-consuming, physically exhausting, and dirty manual and menial labor at the stables, including shoveling horse manure, in an effort to reduce costs. While the taxpayer may have grown up training and racing horses, enjoyed steeplechase training, and loved to ride, she did no steeplechase racing in this country and employed professional jockeys to ride the stable's horses in all races. </li> <li> Taxpayer, although fully employed elsewhere, operated a horse breeding operation for profit where she (1) conducted the operation in a businesslike manner (as evidenced by detailed financial records, a separate bank account, and a business plan, which was modified as needed); (2) increased her expertise in pedigrees and bloodlines by consulting with experts and reading an industry journal, and demonstrated that expertise by serving as a judge at horse shows; (3) spent significant time and effort on the horse breeding activities; and (4) didn't ride the horses she bred. These factors outweighed the fact that the taxpayer's breeding activities had never had a profitable year. The Tax Court also held that the taxpayer had profitably engaged in similar activities in the past, based on the taxpayer's successful operation of a medical billing service. </li> <li> Taxpayers operated a horse training and breeding business for profit even though they had losses in their first eight years. They demonstrated a profit motive by advertising, promotions, professional trainers, maintaining insurance, keeping records, abandoning unprofitable methods, and the amount of time they devoted to the horses in addition to maintaining unrelated full time positions. The taxpayers also demonstrated that the activity could recoup early losses through future earnings and appreciation, and that taxpayer husband's successfully started two unrelated business ventures and made them profitable. They refrained from riding the horses for pleasure and traveling with them to all activity related events. </li> <li> Despite an earlier determination (by the same judge) that taxpayer didn't have a profit motive (footnote 61, above), the Tax Court found taxpayer's continued and modified operations demonstrated the requisite profit motive. The taxpayer had extensive personal expertise, expended significant time on the activity, had a reasonable expectation that the assets would appreciate in value, and had success in other breeding activities. Though he still didn't show a profit, taxpayer, after studying new methods and consulting experts, demonstrated a profit motive by doubling his breeding program through a change from live cover to artificial insemination (which allowed his stallions to breed with more mares and maximized fertilization opportunities, ultimately producing more horses to sell and/or breed). He also worked with veterinarians while they performed the procedure, purchased artificial insemination equipment, and hired a veterinarian to work at his ranch. Taxpayer maintained breeding records, foaling records, records of purchases, sales, deaths and maintenance of his horses, and a database of his mares' breeding habits on a computer. In addition, the taxpayer used industry standard forms and contracts, and registered his breeding activity. </li> <li> Taxpayers' horse boarding activity was conducted for profit. They had the necessary expertise and experience, maintained business-like records, conducted a word-of-mouth campaign to attract customers, and were generally able to rent out more than half of their available stalls. Their losses were largely due to vagaries in the price of hay, and taxpayers took steps to control these costs. Moreover, in connection with the activity, taxpayers expended significant time (including significant travel time between their home and their stables) and significant physical effort, and made out-of-pocket expenditures that were a rather large part of their total income—34% and 46%—for the two tax years in question. </li> <li> Taxpayers' horse breeding activity was conducted for profit. They had significant experience training horses, consulted with appropriate experts, conducted the activity in a businesslike manner, advertised in trade magazines, and attended seminars. In addition, they kept records, and made changes in their methods, in a manner consistent with an intent to improve profitability. They devoted considerable time to, and handled all material aspects of, the activity. They didn't have substantial income or capital from other sources, and devoted all of their savings from their only wage-earning activities to the horse breeding activity. </li> <li> A taxpayer's horse breeding activity was engaged in for profit. He kept better records for that activity than for his wife's cosmetology business, which IRS had agreed was entered into for profit. He had no other job, so he could devote full time to the undertaking. He had consulted experts, and had an informal business plan. One factor in the taxpayer's favor was his attempt to save money and adopt different strategies as he attempted unsuccessfully to make his business profitable. He learned how to take care of the horses himself to save on veterinarian bills, and undertook, when there was a drought that drove up feed prices, to grow his own feed. The taxpayer's personal motives didn't underlie his choice of activities. He seldom rode the horses, and the work he undertook, rising early to feed the horses, cleaning the barns, and staying up all night with sick or pregnant horses, could hardly be described as pleasurable. Although he lost a lot of money, the losses were mostly a result of circumstances beyond his control, and there was considerable evidence that he had attempted to make a profit. </li> <li> Taxpayers had a profit motive for their horse-breeding activities despite running losses for ten years (over $400,000 in total), including all of the years at issue. The court noted no motive other than profit could explain “their willingness to persist in an activity that had become so frustrating and unpleasant.” Although their intent to turn a profit was “objectively” unreasonable, it was their genuine subjective intent. Taxpayers' record-keeping involved a shoebox, but it was adequate for their purposes. They weren't wealthy business people dabbling in horses in their spare time: the wife worked with the horses full time; and the husband devoted all of his nonworking hours to them. And the time spent wasn't in riding horses or attending horse shows, but in grueling, strenuous labor. They had a rudimentary business plan: to weather the loss years and maintain a herd of at least 40 to retain zoning status as an equestrian center. They spent nine years and a substantial amount of funds to clear title to one horse, a purebred Arabian stallion, solely in an attempt to generate profit. Taxpayers' middle class status meant they couldn't afford to maintain the horse activity simply for pleasure if they had no hope of future profits. </li> <li> Taxpayers generally conducted their horse breeding in a businesslike manner, they adapted their plan over time to take into account changing circumstances, and identified potential sources of significant future revenue. The taxpayers showed extensive expertise in the area, spent substantial amounts of time devoted to the operation, and offered well-reasoned justifications for decisions to heal one horse that had prospects, while putting down another horse where they determined the cost to heal her exceeded her projected selling price. These positives offset their sloppy recordkeeping and limited advertising. </li> <li> After success as a nightclub owner, taxpayer acquired property on which horses were boarded and held it for two years primarily motivated by the hope it would appreciate. He then relocated, built a premier training facility, hired experts, became knowledgeable about racing strategies, and devoted substantial time to horse-related activities. He was asked by peers to run for leadership positions in professional horse racing organizations, and lobbied for horse racing interests. His record-keeping system was rudimentary, but sufficient for making informed business decisions. Taxpayer suffered losses (some of which were due to unfortunate circumstances, such as the quarantine and death of several horses) while in the long start-up phase for horse-related activities, but his occasional successes were sufficient to support expectations of eventual profits (e.g., one of his horses was nominated to run in Triple Crown races). While taxpayer was engaged in the social and enjoyable aspects of the business in the earlier years, he thereafter shifted to the less pleasurable area of horse training. The Tax Court held taxpayer established a profit-seeking motive after relocating to the new property, so his losses were disallowed for the first two years at issue and allowed for the later years. But the Seventh Circuit held that taxpayer could deduct his losses for all years at issue, as it believed that the taxpayer's activities in the first two years were preparatory to entering the business and not simply a hobby that later grew into a business. The Seventh Circuit didn't believe that the taxpayer's involvement in horse racing associations in the first two years was merely social and enjoyable but was more in the nature of serving on a corporate board. </li> <li> In what the Tax Court termed a close case, it held taxpayer's activities of purchasing, breeding, and racing horses were profit-motivated. The key factor was taxpayer's reliance on a very successful and experienced trainer, who not only worked with taxpayer's horses but was a co-owner. Because the trainer clearly operated with a profit motive, his substantial involvement lent credence to taxpayer's motivation as well. The court conceded taxpayer took personal pleasure from the activities and had a long history of losses. But it noted that had substantial offers to buy some of his horses been accepted, profits could have been generated in several years. The court also found taxpayer operated his activities in a business-like manner, maintaining thorough and accurate records, and selling horses and otherwise adjusting his business practices in a manner consistent with profit-seeking. </li> <li> Taxpayers conducted their Arabian horse-breeding activities in a business-like manner, using a CPA for financial recordkeeping and a specialty law firm to draft contracts. They developed detailed annual business plans and engaged in extensive advertising and promotional activities. The large number of horses sold by taxpayers, though not resulting in profits most years, showed they weren't merely keeping them as pets. They didn't track their holdings on a horse-by-horse basis but kept sufficient records to make business decisions. They relocated from Florida to California in an attempt to increase profits. They worked full time on the activity, developed a high level of expertise, and relied on qualified outside experts when appropriate. They suffered losses of roughly $1 million a year for a long period (longer than the normal start-up period), but this coincided with a difficult economic climate for Arabian horses and particular problems encountered by taxpayers. And taxpayers did show a substantial profit in one year. </li> </ul> </div>\n\n<div>Numerous decisions under Code Sec. 162 , relating to deductions for a trade or business, for tax years beginning before the enactment of Code Sec. 183 in 1970 are applicable as a guide in determining whether an activity's a for-profit trade or business, because the regs under Code Sec. 183 are largely distilled from these cases.</div>\n\n<div>Many of these decisions hold that raising and maintaining horses for breeding and racing purposes is a trade or business under Code Sec. 162 and that losses incurred in connection with the activities are deductible. On the other hand, deductions were sometimes disallowed on the ground that taxpayer was carrying on a hobby rather than a business.</div>",

        "text": "<div>Under the hobby loss rules, deductions attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit are limited, see ¶  M-5800 et seq. All facts and circumstances must be taken into account in determining whether an activity's engaged in for profit, see ¶  M-5832 et seq.</div>\n\n<div>One indication of a profit motive is if an activity's carried on in a manner that's substantially similar to other activities of the same nature that are profitable.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >In the following situations, the court examined the manner in which the taxpayer conducted the activity to determine whether it was conducted in a manner similar to activities engaged in for profit of the same kind: <ul> <li> Actress-model. Taxpayer's activities as a part-time actress and model were carried on in a businesslike fashion. She had an agent and kept a journal of her auditions and callbacks. </li> <li> Airplane activities. Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> taxpayer's records for his aviation maintenance activities were disorganized and unreliable, and consisted solely of receipts, representing only an effort to substantiate deductions claimed. He presented nothing related to income, such as work orders, invoices, or logbooks. He acquired technical expertise in aviation school, but no business expertise or experience. </li> <li> taxpayer, who enjoyed flying, owned one plane and ran a transport company. But he kept shoddy records, had a minimal client base that brought in income substantially below his expenses, made no changes to generate profits, didn't seek expert guidance, and didn't devote much time to the activity. </li> <li> a taxpayer, who was employed full time at his own computer services company, didn't conduct his aircraft rental activity in a businesslike manner. Taxpayer didn't maintain books and records that would allow either for regular or meaningful evaluation of the enterprise's financial health or for the making of informed business decisions. Taxpayer set the rate charged for use of the aircraft in a “strikingly” unbusinesslike manner by calling other businesses, inquiring what they charged, and establishing a comparable fee. And, taxpayer didn't undertake an analysis of his own expenses, the probable balance of personal versus business use, or his likely break-even point. </li> <li> taxpayer, a licensed airplane pilot and mechanic who, in addition to working full-time for a commercial airline, also engaged in his own airplane activities such as building, improving and flying several small airplanes. The taxpayer didn't engage in those other airplane activities in a businesslike manner. Although the taxpayer testified that he had developed a business plan (to build airplanes from kits and sell them for a substantial profit), he also acknowledged that, during the years at issue, his airplane activity was “a pencil and paper operation.” Other than income tax returns, flight logs, and a business license (issued during the last month of the last year at issue), the taxpayer didn't offer into evidence any written documentation of his business plans or projections, payroll or other employee records, sales contracts he claimed to have entered into, or any other business records about his airplane activity. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Amway distributorship (or similar direct marketing activity). Where the manner in which taxpayers conducted their distributorship activity (e.g., freely incurring expenses with no realistic plan for recouping them, maintaining detailed records for substantiation purposes but not for use as tools to increase the likelihood of profit (see ¶  M-5838 ), and relying only on the advice of insiders who stood to profit from taxpayers participation (see ¶  M-5855 )) virtually precluded any possibility of realizing a profit, they didn't prove they had a profit motive. Although the court recognized the business reasons for taxpayers recruiting of “downline” distributors (i.e., to benefit as “upline” distributors under Amway's bonus program, and to earn commissions on the downline distributors' sales), while selling products to customers and downline distributors at cost, it found the likelihood of taxpayers achieving their bonus point goals (their break-even point) was unrealistic, given that they recruited only family, friends and acquaintances to be downline distributors. And despite four years of losses, taxpayers had failed to change tactics to increase the likelihood of earning a profit. On the other hand, a taxpayer engaged in a similar direct marketing operation was held to be engaged in a profit-seeking activity where he kept records of income and expenses, and of the success rates of his mailings and the size of his customer base. He changed methods and products to improve results. Although he didn't have a formal business plan, the manner in which he conducted the activity evidenced an informal business plan. In addition, he didn't derive personal pleasure from the operations, and didn't use the business as an excuse to disguise personal travel as business trips. </li> <li> Boat chartering. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> taxpayer investigated a number of boat brokers and charter operators; invested in a particular boat for reasons that indicated profit potential was his primary motivation; used charter facilities near his home so he could monitor the charter operation and minimize expenses by doing his own maintenance and upkeep; and negotiated a favorable management agreement that guaranteed a minimum level of revenue and incorporated incentives to encourage the management company to maximize charter revenues. </li> <li> taxpayer, an avid sailor who had profited from selling sailboats in the past, bought a 50-foot racing sailboat (at a bargain price) in order to join a sailing association that held annual races. The boat's good design, decent size, deck layout, good sails, stable platform, and its reasonable price, made it well-suited for racing-related charters. In addition to using a broker, taxpayer also advertised in newspapers and yachting magazines, maintained a Web site, sent out promotional materials, and placed the boat in “the most visible” regattas. A separate bank account was maintained for the sailboat venture. Taxpayer's wife, who was experienced in the couple's real estate business activities, kept careful books and records of the boat's income and expenses. Taxpayer sought to cut costs by dismissing the boat's full-time captain, hiring crew only as needed, refinancing the boat, and having it reappraised to lower insurance rates. </li> <li> the taxpayers worked out a five-year projection and determined they could make a profit on their operation. They advertised and sought innovative techniques for promoting their operation. They continually looked for methods to improve the boat and their service to make their business more attractive to potential customers, and for ways to cut their costs. </li> </ul> Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> a medical doctor entered the yacht chartering business and didn't investigate the income projections of the seller, devoted little time to the activity, and didn't personally carry on any chartering activity. </li> <li> a plastic surgeon (taxpayer) with no yacht-owning experience or written business plan, spent more than $3.5 million to buy and restore a luxury Feadship (top-of-the-line) yacht. It was represented that the yacht was being sold under distress conditions, and could be restored and resold at a substantial profit. A written marine survey set forth the yacht's fair market value and a replacement cost more than three times that amount, but the survey was made before the yacht had been pulled out of the water, and so didn't account for the rust and corrosion to the steel hull. Although the survey didn't include an estimate of restoration costs, taxpayer didn't independently investigate the costs or set up a budget for them. Nor did he properly monitor the work. </li> <li> taxpayers didn't operate their yacht-chartering activity in a business-like manner: the taxpayers used a marina for their yacht chartering activity even though they believed that the marina prohibited commercial usage of its slips; they failed to enforce compliance with the terms of a chartering agreement that they entered into with a yachting club; they maintained inadequate records of the business and pleasure use of the yacht; and they purchased a pleasure boat insurance policy that was never upgraded to apply to commercial usage. </li> <li> the taxpayer went into the yacht chartering business through his S corporation without determining whether it was realistic to expect sufficient revenues to earn a profit. Although the operation kept proper records, produced advertising brochures, and dealt with the taxpayer as an outsider, there was no investigation of the chances of earning a profit. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Cattle farming/ranching. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> the taxpayer used good business practices similar to those he had developed for his business of selling and servicing filters for automatic and diesel equipment. He showed good business judgment in trying to minimize the costs of preparing for cattle the pasture land he bought. When it became clear that he couldn't successfully maintain a stocker-calf operation, he immediately began a cow-calf operation to keep his pastures grazed and to reduce his losses. </li> <li> the taxpayer pursued his cattle farm operation with much of the same dedication and devotion he applied to making his toolmaking business a success. Before starting the farm, he consulted with several experts who had extensive experience raising cattle. He continued to consult experts during the farm's operation, and also subscribed to weekly and monthly cattle farming publications. He spent about 50 hours a week working on the farm, and employed a local agricultural extension agent to work with him there. </li> <li> the taxpayer employed competent farm consultants and resident farm managers in the operation of the farm and tried to develop a reputation for his breeding herd by showing the animals, which won a number of local and area prizes over the years. When the breeding herd failed to produce a profit, he tried to convert his losses into profits by growing tobacco and starting a feeder cattle operation. When the feeder cattle operation failed to produce a profit, it was abandoned. </li> <li> taxpayer hired an experienced live-in ranch hand to manage the day-to-day operations of his cattle breeding operations. Although taxpayer didn't have a written business plan for the operation, he kept an expense ledger and anticipated that the activity would start to show a profit once his herd reached 100 “productive” cows, he tripled his herd during the years at issue. Taxpayer's failure to advertise for on-site customers wasn't fatal; the advertising wasn't necessary because the cattle was sold at off-site auctions for prices that were in line with market prices. </li> </ul> Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> an airline pilot, who was about to retire, conducted his cattle raising activities to provide his family with a place to live and to keep himself occupied during his spare time while employed and full-time after retirement. He kept no records of the animals' characteristics or bloodlines when he began the cattle breeding operation. The small size of the herd resulted in a low volume of sales. </li> <li> a general partner didn't operate his cattle breeding partnerships in a businesslike manner. His reliance on the seller of some cattle for information about the value and anticipated sales of the assets acquired showed poor business practice. He executed a sales contract without specifying the number of cattle and embryos to be purchased, and allowed embryo transplant operations to be performed outside the herd manager's ranch in violation of the original sales contract. </li> <li> the taxpayers, who engaged in an embryo transplant cattle and miniature horse breeding activity, didn't operate the activity in a business-like manner, had little time to devote to the activity and ignored the continuing losses from the activity. </li> <li> the taxpayer carried on his cattle-raising activity in a “markedly casual manner.” He made no serious effort to make an informed business judgment on the economic prospects of his venture over a series of seven consecutive tax years in which it produced a loss. He didn't maintain business records for the activity. The farm on which the taxpayer conducted this activity wasn't suitable for cattle farming. Taxpayer made no attempt to seek expert advice from the county extension agent with respect to raising cattle. </li> <li> the taxpayers—who continued to acquire significant acreage, improve it, and put cattle on it —realized losses every year for fourteen years and never came close to making a profit from their cattle ranch. They spent limited time working the ranch and failed to maintain formal books and records, e.g., a ledger, a budget, or a meaningful business plan. While they kept all expense receipts to substantiate ranch-related expenses, this was more indicative of good tax planning than a for-profit business. The taxpayer's assertion that he expected the cattle ranch to provide retirement income based on the successful breeding of cows was undermined by the lack of breeding and calving records and by the taxpayers' sale each year of all their female calves. </li> <li> the taxpayers (husband and wife) with no previous farming experience bought an 80-acre ranch where they maintained approximately 25 cattle and 60 sheep. The husband was a successful engineer, and also ran a profitable consulting service. The wife had some experience raising game birds, and the couple unsuccessfully tried to use the ranch for that purpose. The couple then switched to livestock. But there was no evidence to show they conducted an analysis or investigation of the profitability of farming in their area; they began buying goats and sheep after learning that neighboring farms were raising those animals. Given the husband's financial and fiscal experience, it was significant that he didn't prepare an analysis of the revenues and expenses the property could achieve with more livestock (either cattle or sheep) to determine whether it could then be operated at a profit. </li> <li> the taxpayer, who was employed full-time at his own computer services company, didn't maintain records for his cattle ranching activity from which he could make a cost accounting or analysis, allowed the land he purchased for grazing to sit unused for six years before placing cattle on it, made only minimal efforts to improve profitability—making a small number of improvements to the ranch over a seven-year period—and didn't have a formal business plan, testifying, instead, that his plan was to “buy cows, feed cows, sell cows.” It was doubtful taxpayer had any plan to profit where he testified, without supporting documents, that he needed to sell about 40 cows to make a profit, but in none of the years at issue had even attempted to place 40 cows on his property. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Computer-equipment sale and leaseback. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> the taxpayer personally researched the transaction, consulted his accountants and accepted their recommendation that more equipment be added at no additional cost to increase the residual value potential of the leased equipment he was purchasing. </li> <li> the taxpayer was a limited partner in an enterprise in which all the parties involved were knowledgeable about the computer industry; the leases had been negotiated at arm's length; an independent appraiser predicted that the residual value of the computer after the lease term would be at least 20% of the partnership's cost. </li> <li> the lessee was a major telephone company that was likely to renew its lease, eliminating problem of finding a new user after the initial lease term, and the useful life of the equipment at the time of the lease was relatively long. </li> </ul> On the other hand, taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where the taxpayer organized limited partnerships for the purpose of subleasing computer systems that the partnerships would get through a lease from corporations controlled by the taxpayer. The limited partnerships never subleased any of the computer systems, nor could the taxpayer show that any significant attempts were made to sublease the systems. </li> <li> Condominium rental. Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where taxpayer's friend wanted to buy a home for his family but couldn't afford to do it by himself, so taxpayer joined his friend in buying a condominium. Each paid one-half of the down payment and was liable on the purchase price mortgage. Taxpayer's friend and his family lived in the condo and made all of the mortgage payments. He didn't pay any rent to taxpayer, except to the extent he paid taxpayer's half of the monthly mortgage payments. The Tax Court found that taxpayer engaged in the condominium activity to accommodate his friend rather than to make a profit. </li> <li> Delivery service. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where: taxpayer delivered x-rays from a hospital to a medical center and returned them the next morning. She got the job with a successful bid of $50 because she knew that the person who held the contract before she did had been paid that much. She increased her bid the following year because she believed that the cost and trouble of transporting the x-rays was worth more than $50 a month. In computing the bids, she took into account the amount of out-of-pocket expenses (gas, etc.) she would incur plus the costs of any necessary extra trips. There was a penalty if she failed to deliver and pick up the x-rays on time. On days when she worked late at her regular job or took off, she arranged for one of her children to do the work for her. </li> <li> Dog breeding. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> a geologist left her profession to do work in a dog breeding activity. She worked 80-100 hours a week, and her husband worked 20-30 hours a week, in the operation. Although there were losses in the start-up years, they decreased steadily, and, eventually, a profit was realized. Taxpayers were certified by a national organization of dog groomers and won several national championships with dogs they bred and groomed. </li> <li> the taxpayers, husband and wife with full-time jobs, built a kennel adequate to house the dogs used in their dog breeding activities and acquired supplies and equipment suitable for raising them. They exhibited their dogs at shows in attempts to establish a good reputation for their kennel, so that they could demand a higher price for their puppies. Furthermore, they advertised and sent cards to prospective customers to spur sales and kept records necessary to keep track of the kennel's profitability. </li> </ul> On the other hand, taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where only five of taxpayer's 28 dogs generated any income, taxpayer didn't maintain any records that tracked income and expenses attributable to particular dogs, taxpayer didn't have any business plan, didn't do anything to develop a strategy that would make the activity profitable, and, even though the activity generated persistent losses, didn't alter the manner in which she conducted the activity to increase the likelihood of a profit. </li> <li> Equipment leasing. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where the taxpayer leased solar water heating systems. Taxpayer bought the equipment under an arrangement obligating him to lease it, for a seven-year period, to another corporation that would, in turn, sublease it to homeowners. He wasn't obligated further during the initial seven-year lease term, when there was a guarantee of rental income. Taxpayer's leasing of computer equipment to his law firm was a profit-seeking activity. He was an astute businessman and attorney who earned substantial income from his law practice in part through his expertise in operating the equipment. He set the leasing business up on the advice of his accountant to replace wage income with rental income. He collected rent on the leases except for the years at issue when the firm's income was off. He conducted the operation in a businesslike manner, and there was no element of personal pleasure involved. </li> <li> Exotic animal farm. Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where an osteopath operating an exotic animal farm didn't keep an inventory, a medical history, or nutrition record on his animals. He had no experience in managing this type of farm and didn't seek advice. He kept the animals in very poor surroundings, increasing their mortality and reducing their market value. </li> <li> Farming. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where the taxpayer, who was also a partner in a law firm during the tax years in issue, conducted his farming activity in a businesslike manner. He hired an accountant experienced in farm accounting to review and maintain his records which were accurate and timely. He consulted with state officials on how to improve his farm's prospects. He implemented new farming techniques and introduced new crops. He regularly experimented with new sources of revenue, two of which were very successful. The court rejected IRS's arguments that taxpayer's failure to prepare detailed feasibility studies and his failure to hire outside managers or consultants indicated that the farm wasn't operated in a businesslike manner. On the other hand, taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where the taxpayer worked on his farm in his spare time and his primary occupation (as a physician) prevented him from doing the work on the farm that he conceded was necessary to make it profitable. Moreover, he didn't expand either his farm or his herd of cattle even though he believed that the expansion was necessary for the farm to be profitable. The Fourth Circuit emphasized the fact that the taxpayer was aware of steps he might have taken, but failed to take, to improve the farm's profitability. And an attorney (taxpayer), who had no previous farming experience, wasn't engaged in apple and hardwood timber farming activities with a profit motive where he didn't conduct the activity in a businesslike manner (i.e., he didn't have a written business plan, didn't separate apple and timber activity expenses, didn't prepare budgets, and offered no proof of the number of trees planted, their cost or their condition) didn't consult experts, didn't have employees, spent only one day a month on the activities, incurred losses over the 14–16 years he engaged in the activities, and had a vacation home on the property. Here, at most, the taxpayer had an investment, if, as he claimed, he was waiting for the hardwood trees to mature (in 40 years) to recover his costs, and turn a profit. </li> <li> Fishing. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where; <ul> <li> the taxpayers participated in a noncontractual franchise in which they were allowed to use the name of Couple Assn. of Sport Tournaments (CAST)—which organized and hosted bass fishing tournaments—in their region and to keep part of the gross receipts in return for paying all expenses. Taxpayers, who devoted substantial amounts of their time to their fishing activity, widely advertised and engaged in numerous promotional activities. They regularly consulted an expert on fishing tournaments and kept detailed business records and mailing lists. They continued to study and perfect new techniques to improve the quality and profitability of their fishing activity (e.g., by soliciting local sponsors for lodging and meals and by arranging for a corporate sponsor to pay the taxpayers' boat show booth fees in exchange for publicity). </li> <li> the taxpayer, who was able to arrange his work schedule so that he spent only 26 weeks a year on his electrical contractor job, devoted significant time and effort in operating his commercial fishing boat. Taxpayer maintained adequate books and records, changed his operating methods to reduce costs and increase efficiency, refinanced the boat to reduce interest expense, designed and developed mechanical devices to save money and reduce crew costs, chartered his boat out during down time and performed all maintenance work on the fishing gear. </li> <li> the taxpayer, an experienced harpoon fisherman, established a separate bank account for his fishing activity and kept logs of weather and tide conditions. The fact that he was unable to fish one year because the fishing quota was filled at an unexpectedly early date didn't indicate the lack of a profit motive. </li> </ul> Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> the taxpayer, an avid fisherman and boat owner, outfitted his boat for commercial fishing but failed to systematically devote his efforts to commercial fishing. The taxpayer limited his commercial fishing activities to weekend trips; chartered his boat to sport fisherman; entered sport fishing tournaments using his commercial boat; used a sport fishing technique (trolling) rather than the technique (bottom fishing) that was the standard practice among successful local commercial fisherman. Furthermore, the taxpayer didn't determine the potential profitability of the operation before he began fishing. </li> <li> the taxpayer, an attorney representing his client, won an $800,000 judgment against the owners of a fishing boat. The owners went bankrupt and the boat was auctioned off. Taxpayer bought the boat, built three years earlier at a cost of $700,000, for $100,000. For several years, taxpayer relied on his client to find experienced fishermen to operate the boat, but its fishing activities didn't show a profit. Thereafter, taxpayer entered into an informal profit-sharing arrangement with a commercial fisherman under which the boat was operated by a corporation owned by the fisherman's son. Taxpayer lent the company various amounts of money to finance the activity, but the boat again failed to make a profit. Taxpayer still owns the boat. Taxpayer's intent in buying the boat and engaging in its fishing activities was to help his client and to try to collect his attorney's fees. Taxpayer didn't carry on the activity in a businesslike manner, had no expertise in the fishing business, didn't consult expert advisers, devoted only a small amount of time to the activity, never turned a profit and should have had no reasonable expectation that the assets used in the fishing activity would ever appreciate in value. </li> <li> the taxpayer, an accomplished recreational fisherman, failed to conduct his tournament fishing activity in a manner consistent with a profit objective. Factors evidencing a lack of profit objective included: taxpayer's full-time managerial position at a car dealership; his failure to assess chances of recouping cumulative expenses from unprofitable years; entering only weekend tournaments; inconsistent reporting of tournament winnings, unsophisticated method of retaining expense records that hindered his ability to determine progress toward profitability, and failure to seek expert advice on how to make his fishing profitable. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Horse breeding, racing, training and showing. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> the taxpayer-spouses engaged in the activity of breeding and racing quarter horses. The husband worked on this activity virtually all weekends while he worked as a miner, and nearly every day when he was injured. The wife, a full-time bookkeeper, worked at least 20 hours a week in the horse breeding and racing operation. They hired top horse trainers and used the services of professional jockeys and a veterinarian. </li> <li> taxpayer maintained adequate records, operated his horse breeding activity in a businesslike manner, had extensive expertise about horse breeding, expended significant time on his breeding activity, had a reasonable expectation that the assets used in the activity would appreciate in value, and had success in previous breeding activity </li> <li> the taxpayer operated his horse breeding and racing activity in a business-like manner by maintaining accurate records of his activity, hiring a trainer, paying experts to care for his horses, advertising the sale of his horses in trade journals, selling foals, training and racing those horses who had a potential to win races, and modifying his business plan as needed. </li> <li> taxpayers who registered with the Arabian Registry as breeders kept complete financial books and records for their Arabian horse-related activities, as well as detailed records on the horses and their training. They consulted with a noted horse expert, built a barn, stable and arena, and advertised their horses by showing them at horse shows. Their business plan appropriately considered the costs of operating the horse-related activities. They minimized expenses by building most of the barn, stable and exercise area themselves, and reduced daily feed costs by buying the hay from a neighbor. They negotiated reduced purchase prices for their horses by offering a foal for a reduction in the cash price. </li> <li> the taxpayer placed ads in local newspapers and magazines when he wanted to sell a horse or offer a stallion for stud services. He also stopped purchasing thoroughbreds when he determined he couldn't profit from the undertaking. </li> <li> the taxpayer took more than a year to buy a new mare to replace one that died, out of concern with maintaining as high a quality of bloodline as possible. He held two geldings as the operation's only horses for a period of time, although a profit could have only been achieved by selling them. Both horses had achieved great success as show horses and were of considerable value to taxpayer as an advertisement of the quality of his horses. </li> <li> the taxpayers (husband and wife) operated a farm on which they bred, trained, and sold horses. The wife spent substantial time cleaning, feeding, grooming and training horses, while her husband, a doctor, performed routine medical care and maintained the land, built and repaired fences, worked in the barn and occasionally cared for the horses. Taxpayer's children worked several hours a day riding and doing barn work. Complete and accurate books and records were kept. Various methods were used to maintain breeding productivity. Efforts were made to minimize expenses and considerable time was spent advertising and selling the horses. </li> <li> two married airline employees operated a farm on which they bred and trained quarter horses and held rodeos. They advertised, consulted with experts, built a barn and arena, hired professional rodeo companies and a professional trainer, kept financial records as their accountant requested, had a separate checking account for the business, bought mares in foal, registered their horses with the American Quarter Horse Association, and abandoned the business as soon as they were convinced it would be unprofitable. Although they had no written business plan their business plan was evidenced by their actions. </li> <li> although taxpayers had no written business plan, the fact that they had a plan—to earn money by breeding top horses to run in superior races—was evidenced by their actions and attempted changes to improve profitability. The taxpayers consulted with knowledgeable individuals about horse breeding and began to “breed up” by upgrading their brood mares and the stallions with which they were bred. The plan produced foals that performed better at the racetrack. </li> <li> the taxpayer kept complete and accurate books and records, culled the herd, advertised in trade publications, and sent prize horses to stallion parades. Although the operations weren't profitable, the largest losses occurred when taxpayer was changing the horse operation from part-time to full-time and decreased once full-time activities began. </li> <li> the taxpayers generally conducted their horse breeding in a businesslike manner, they adapted their plan over time to take into account changing circumstances, and identified potential sources of significant future revenue. The taxpayers showed extensive expertise in the area, spent substantial amounts of time devoted to the operation, and offered well-reasoned justifications for decisions to heal one horse that had prospects, while putting down another horse where they determined the cost to heal her exceeded the projected price in selling her. These positives offset their sloppy recordkeeping and limited advertising. </li> </ul> Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> investors in horse programs didn't attempt to compel certain companies that were managing the activities to (1) account for the proceeds of these activities or (2) meet the companies' obligations under certain agreements, they didn't engage in the activities with a profit objective. Although a taxpayer may leave the conduct of his business to others (i.e., managers), any prudent investor would require periodic accountings from these managers. Further, a prudent investor would have inquired as to the identity and quality of the horses they were buying. But two of the programs each consisted of four, unidentified horses that were sold to taxpayers for $400,000. </li> <li> the taxpayers operated a horse farm on a relatively informal basis. They kept their cancelled checks but didn't prepare any books. They carried almost no insurance on the horses and hired professional trainers in only two of 21 years in operation. While they were away from their activity in the winter months, the taxpayers hired untrained part-time employees to feed the horses. They only advertised in years when they wanted to sell a horse and never spent more than a few hundred dollars a year on advertisements. </li> <li> taxpayers, who reported losses for 23 of 26 years of breeding and showing “cutting horses,” didn't conduct their activity, as they contended, in a manner substantially similar to two other breeders, each of whom had run profitable horse operations for about 40 years. Taxpayers (i) kept fewer horses and bred them much less extensively, (ii) didn't enter horses in competition as extensively, and (iii) most importantly, didn't train other people's horses (an activity from which the breeders earned income) and, instead, paid others (in significant amounts) to train their horses. </li> <li> taxpayer showed a lack of concern for cash-flow by failing to maintain books of account, reconcile his bank statement every month (or even open the envelopes containing the statement and canceled checks), or use checks only from the account dedicated to the horse-related activity. </li> <li> taxpayers claimed that their business plan focused on breeding, but they had two of their three stallions gelded and bred the third stallion only with a mare that had a history of foaling failures. In six years, they didn't get a single foal or breeding fee. </li> <li> taxpayers created a business plan for their horse breeding activity, but didn't make decisions in accordance with the plan, or with projections or analyses of the costs required to carry on the activity in a profitable manner. Although they revised their business plan several times, each revision was based on the projections contained in the earlier plans, rather than on actual expenses. </li> <li> although taxpayer kept adequate records for her throughbred horse breeding and racing activities separate from her personal records, and employed a CPA to prepare financial statements, she failed to make meaningful changes in her horse operations despite a 14-year history of significant (over $1.1 million) losses. Her enduring losses of this magnitude without making changes showed she didn't conduct her horse-related activities in a businesslike manner. </li> <li> taxpayers didn't conduct their horse-related activities in a businesslike manner. They didn't have bills of sale for every horse they owned, and insured only some of them. They didn't try to collect debts owed to them. Although they hired professionals to work as grooms, braiders, horseshoers and veterinarians, they bought the horses their teenage daughters wanted. They had records reporting substantial losses (over $300,000 per year), but never developed a written business plan or made a budget. They wrote out “business goals” for the years at issue, but didn't have a plan to achieve those goals. Their testimony that their “business plan” was to buy, train, show and sell horses was merely a description of their horse-related activities; it wasn't a plan. </li> <li> the taxpayers, an emergency room physician and firefighter medic, weren't entitled to treat their Arabian horse breeding and training activities as for-profit because they didn't operate the activity in a business-like manner. Taxpayers didn't track their expenses on a per-horse basis, prepare financial projections evaluating the activity's economic performance, establish a real business plan, keep activity expenses separate from personal expenses, or advertise sale of horse stock in trade magazines, journals, or other written publications. </li> <li> the taxpayers produced virtually no business records for their horse breeding, training, and racing activities other than: income and expense statements prepared with QuickBooks software; a business plan that included only generalized goals for the operation; and a year-by-year narrative account of notable events occurring in the horse-related activities. No records existed before 2002, so the taxpayers couldn't determine their total losses since they began the horse-related activities in 1984. They didn't produce separate records for each of their horses to demonstrate that they tracked breeding results and racing performance. Nor did they produce any records that showed that they reviewed each of their specific horse-related activities of quarter horse racing, thoroughbred racing, breeding, and pinhooking (i.e., buying a young horse and training it to the point it can begin racing) to assess which activities were more profitable. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Investment consulting. Taxpayer, who was employed full-time as an engineer, didn't engage in investment consulting for profit, in part because he didn't conduct those activities in a businesslike manner. Taxpayer didn't have a separate office for these activities; he met clients at restaurants, and prepared client presentations and performed administrative tasks at home. He didn't maintain a separate business telephone line or a separate business bank account, and didn't keep client lists. Although taxpayer contended that he rented space to store the activity's records, he failed to present those records at trial and even testified that he had discarded them. </li> <li> Land clearing. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where taxpayer, together with a partner, bought a bulldozer for the purpose of developing land. When it turned out that the land couldn't be developed because of a right of way dispute, the partners tried to operate a land clearing business. When the taxpayer determined that his partner wasn't diligent in operating the business, the taxpayer bought out his partner and looked for a new partner. The fact that the taxpayer changed his operating methods in response to the changed conditions weighed in favor of a finding that the taxpayer had a profit motive. </li> <li> Legal practice. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where the taxpayer devoted substantial time and effort to building her law practice. The practice was the taxpayer's full-time occupation. She maintained regular office hours and performed the typical functions of a sole practitioner attorney. </li> <li> Music. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> the taxpayer, an accountant, worked with a successful producer in promoting songs he wrote and a singer he discovered. He hired a back-up band, rehearsed and booked them, then fired them when they began making problems on the bookings. He signed the singer to management and recording contracts, copyrighted his songs, and established a separate checking account for the business. </li> <li> the taxpayer, a manager and financial backer of musical groups, managed his wife's music career in the same professional and business-like manner as he used in managing and financing other musical acts. He also secured a recording contract for his wife with CBS. </li> </ul> Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> the taxpayer, a full-time quality engineer, who played guitar with his church choir, didn't conduct his music activity in a business-like manner (failing to keep business books, records or accounts), didn't consult with experts in the music industry, and, besides handing out compact discs, on which he was listed as a contributing guitarist, to some people in the music industry, didn't advertise or promote his activity and made no reasonable efforts to gain recognition as a musician playing Christian music for hire. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Oil and gas drilling. Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where the taxpayer organized and promoted a limited partnership to conduct oil and gas drilling activities even though the taxpayer had no previous experience in oil and gas drilling. The entity chosen by the taxpayer to serve as the partnership's placement agent had never established a profitable oil and gas drilling program. The driller chosen by the taxpayer had no previous experience in the oil or gas business. When the driller breached his agreement to provide producing wells, the taxpayer could provide no evidence that he attempted to enforce the terms of the contract. </li> <li> Race car driving. Taxpayer's drag racing activities were conducted for profit where he kept careful separate accounts and developed a business plan. He had substantial expertise in racing and considerable business knowledge, and devoted a good deal of time to it. Taxpayer had an income from other activities but not enough to enable him to engage in drag racing on a nonprofit basis. He incurred losses for seven years while developing the activity, but then acquired a sponsor and earned a small profit. Unexpected loss of the sponsor led to a return to losses. Significantly, when it became clear to taxpayer he wouldn't be able to make the activity profitable, he terminated it. There was an element of personal pleasure in the activity for taxpayer but many aspects that were unpleasant as well, such as heat and discomfort. Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> a father sponsored his son's racing activities through his wholly owned S corporation. The corporation's stated goal was to sponsor professional sports. No other sports activities were sponsored by the corporation. An oral agreement between the corporation and the son for payment of the son's expenses and salary in return for any factory sponsorship salary was never honored. It was highly unrealistic, in light of his racing record, that the son would ever get a sponsor. </li> <li> taxpayer's failure to procure any substantial sponsorships for his drag racing operation, along with a lack of books, budget, bank account, and business plan, showed that he didn't have a bona fide profit motive. </li> <li> taxpayers didn't operate their drag racing activities in a business-like manner. Despite taxpayers' knowledge about drag racing, race cars and motors they didn't make any concerted effort to improve their performance at competitions by, for example, consulting with expert advisers, or with advisers who could help taxpayers make their activities profitable. Taxpayers didn't attempt to develop a business plan, prepare profit projections, or maintain adequate books and records. Moreover, the court found that taxpayers derived considerable personal satisfaction from the activity. </li> <li> taxpayer was an expert on drag racing but didn't conduct his drag racing activities in a business-like manner, i.e., he maintained no records, had no business plan, didn't create budgets, didn't seek business advice, and expected the cars to appreciate in value independently of the drag racing activities. Taxpayer derived much personal pleasure from his drag racing activities, and his expenses and losses greatly exceeded (by 54 times) the small amount of income (only $2,150) the activities generated. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Real estate sales. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where taxpayer, who had successfully worked as a real estate salesperson, stopped working for three years after moving to another city, but then got a job there. She joined a local real estate board, actively solicited names from multiple listing books, called on persons who had advertised houses for sale, went on weekly tours of new listings, and sent out circulars and information to people in the area of her office. She showed individuals houses two or three times a week, and interviewed people who were considering listing their houses for sale. </li> <li> Research/writing. Taxpayer, a part-time professor of modern history, had no business plan, kept no books or records for his research and writing activities, commingled personal funds with activity funds, and made no effort to reduce expenses or generate income in the face of consistent losses. </li> <li> Sports memorabilia activities. Taxpayer, a full-time engineer with a side business providing technical software services, didn't conduct his sports memorabilia activities in a business-like manner. He kept receipts for his expenses, but didn't maintain complete and accurate books and records and didn't keep a separate bank account for the activity. He didn't prepare budgets, income statements, balance sheets, forecasts, or any financial statement to show he used his records to improve his bottom line. </li> <li> Tree farm/timber farm. Taxpayers' activities were engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> the taxpayers carried on their timber farm activity in a business-like manner. They worked hard and long hours on the timber farm, hired competent people to manage and secure the property on a day-to-day basis, and made necessary and significant improvements (e.g., new building, roads and reservoir) to the timber farm. They didn't use the timber farm for personal entertainment, recreation, or retirement. They were creative and innovative in attempting to improve the timber farm and eventually realize a substantial overall net profit. Although taxpayers' homemade bookkeeping system was amateurish, it did capture extensive information and track expenses. </li> </ul> Taxpayers' activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> taxpayers engaged in tree-farming, apiary (beekeeping), and rental activities failed to acquire the necessary local business licenses to sell their produce and didn't maintain any formal business plans, budgets, ledgers, or other accounting records. The taxpayers didn't keep any mileage logs or formal records of payments made to their undocumented workers and failed to keep separate bank accounts.While the taxpayers argued that these were inherently high risk businesses that often require a lengthy start-up period, these activities were conducted well beyond any reasonably start-up period with continual, increasing losses that the taxpayers took no meaningful action to control. Taxpayers' losses were due to their unchecked expenditures and failure to develop a suitable market for their produce. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Writing. Taxpayer's activities were engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> taxpayer carried on his television and movie screenplay writing activity in a businesslike fashion. Taxpayer hired agents to help him negotiate prices for his screenplays, had numerous contacts in the business, and devoted much time and energy to carrying on this activity. </li> </ul> Taxpayer's activities weren't engaged in for profit where: <ul> <li> some aspects of taxpayer's article and novel writing activity (relating to contemporary political commentary, guns and travel) were conducted in a businesslike manner, but other aspects weren't. Taxpayer maintained records of his expenses and regularly researched and submitted articles and novels to various periodicals and literary agents. But, although his articles weren't accepted for publication (during a 17-year period), he didn't develop a strategy to get published, or make changes in order to succeed. And, taxpayer, who wasn't a gun-testing expert, conducted his testing and incurred gun-related expenses without determining if there was any interest in the articles, and without regard to the income he could objectively earn. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div>",

Taxpayers made various items (needle work and wooden toys) by hand and sold them at craft shows. In pricing the items they sold, taxpayers took into account only the cost of direct materials used in producing the items. They didn't consider fixed and variable costs, such as their compensation for the activity, advertising, and car expenses which they claimed as business deductions. Also, the cost of supplies ranged from 80% to more than twice the gross sales. The court found it hard to reconcile this fact, assuming that the receipts were fully reported, with the taxpayers' claim that they charged a 50% mark-up.</div>\n\n<div>Absence of a profit objective in the operation of aircraft by an S corporation was indicated by the fact that, although the corporation imposed charges for the flights by passengers—who consisted almost exclusively of the president and sole shareholder of the corporation, his family and business acquaintances—the charges were not determined with regard to the aircraft's actual costs, and the charges were never paid by the passengers themselves, but by other business entities related to the corporation.</div>",

The taxpayers explicitly sought a source of supplemental income that wouldn't interfere with the considerable demands made by their executive-level positions.</div>\n\n<div>Where taxpayer spent numerous hours per week on his fiction writing activities, the fact that he worked 40 hours per week as a budget analyst was not an indication that the fiction-writing activities weren't engaged in for profit. Maintaining a full-time job in addition to the writing activities was seen as a positive factor reflecting taxpayer's motivation, and didn't support a negative inference about the lack of a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer, a partner at a law firm who billed 30–35 hours per week during the tax years at issue, spent evenings and weekends working on her documentary film. Her position as a partner didn't mean that her filmmaking activity wasn't a trade or business. Rather, it gave her the flexibility she needed to work on her documentary. The Tax Court noted that a taxpayer can engage in more than one trade or business at any one time. </div>\n\n<div>That a taxpayer had a full-time job in another field didn't hurt his case where the court said it would have been foolish for him to dive into business full-time until he knew he could support himself from the activity.</div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer who spent nearly as much time farming as he did flying as a commercial pilot, did most of the farm labor himself with the help only of his family, and operated the farm in a business-like manner had a profit motive in his farm activity.</div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer with a full-time job in another field had a profit motive for his cattle breeding activity where (1) he got up early during the week to work on the cattle breeding operation, spent nearly all his weekends tending to the cattle, and never took a vacation because of his farm responsibilities, (2) he fed the cattle before and after work, spent additional time as needed before and after calving, for cattle wormings and vaccinations, in harvesting hay, and in maintaining farm equipment.</div>\n\n<div>A former championship boxer had a profit motive for his farming activity where, during the few weeks a year he spent on the farm, he spent most of his time working on farm improvements. He mended fences, worked in the fields, and made other repairs.</div>\n\n<div>The time a taxpayer devoted to his security-dog business, about one hour per day, was substantial enough to support a profit motive considering that he was involved in a large number of other business ventures.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >Taxpayer, an airline pilot who worked 1-to-2 weeks on and then 1-to-2 weeks off, had substantial blocks of time to devote to a project to develop a wind-powered distillery for the production of ethanol. He testified that at certain points he “tried” to spend 35 to 40 hours a week on the project. This supported a conclusion that the activity was profit-motivated, although the court found a lack of profit motive based on other factors.</div>\n\n<div>On the other hand, a profit motive isn't indicated where: <ul> <li> taxpayer's time and effort spent on an activity was insignificant when compared to his full-time occupation, i.e., where only one event or transaction occurs. </li> <li> taxpayer admitted he spent no time or effort on the activity. </li> <li> a flight attendant was unable to show how much time she spent at her part-time antique store. </li> <li> taxpayer, who worked 40 hours a week in his full-time job as an engineer, failed to show that his investment consulting business was more than a spare time activity. Taxpayer's claim that he spent all his spare time—30 to 40 hours each week—in the consulting activities, was found to be exaggerated. The only substantiation offered for the amount of time spent in those activities was a diary, and taxpayer conceded that the diary entries weren't even written contemporaneously. </li> <li> taxpayer devoted only a minimal amount of time and effort to racing boats. Taxpayer, a general partner in a construction firm, engaged in boat racing on only 15 weekends during the year. </li> <li> an electrician whose work frequently required him to be away from home (and thus away from racing) for months at a time couldn't prove he ever devoted more than his spare time on available weekends to stock car racing. </li> <li> taxpayer, a practicing surgeon, failed to spend more than 13 hours per week working his ranch. </li> <li> taxpayer, an attorney, was employed full-time by the U.S. Department of Justice, whose regulations prohibited the private practice of law by its employees except for pro bono services provided to the general public and services provided to certain relatives or personal fiduciaries. The taxpayer spent an estimated 50-100 hours each year on activities designed mainly to help the taxpayer keep his contacts and maintain a foundation for his reentry into private practice at some future date. </li> <li> taxpayer, president and sole shareholder of a fuel oil delivery company, claimed he spent approximately two days per week working on his farm, which was 175 miles from his home. The court found his claim wasn't credible where he deducted only $100 for travel expenses in each of the years at issue and each of the various farming activities failed in part through his neglect. </li> <li> taxpayer, a part-time student, collected fares in her taxicab activity for 44 days during the year, less than one day per week, and for less than 2% of the cars' total mileage. </li> <li> taxpayer spent most of his time and effort on his fireplace business, which required frequent travel and overnight business trips. His quarter horse breeding activity was a hobby. </li> <li> taxpayer, the sole owner of three mail order book publishing/marketing corporations, expended some time in purchasing a yacht but didn't invest any significant time or personal effort with respect to yacht-chartering activities. </li> <li> taxpayer's practice of not offering his sailboat for charter unless he was present on it made it impossible for him to charter it enough to make a profit in view of the lengthy hours he worked in his regular job as a union official. </li> <li> where taxpayer, who worked full time for his own computer services company, devoted only a negligible amount of time to his aircraft rental business, didn't advertise or market the rental business, only rented the plane to his own company, and 65% to 75% of the plane's usage for the years at issue was for travel to and from taxpayer's cattle ranch (an activity also found not to have been engaged in for profit). </li> <li> there was no evidence in the record as to how many hours taxpayer devoted to his automobile repair activity, but he could not have spent a significant amount of time on that activity since, based on the salary he earned as a jet airplane mechanic for American Airlines, he worked full time for that company. </li> <li> taxpayer's time and effort spent on his part-time charter fishing activity was insubstantial. Taxpayer had a full-time job elsewhere and worked as a bartender at nights and on weekends. </li> <li> for most of the time that taxpayers engaged in a horse training, stabling, and breeding activity, they worked as full-time pipefitters and expended only a minimal amount of time and effort managing their horses. They worked with the horses in the early morning and evening hours and weekends. Taxpayers spent an insignificant amount of time showing their horses. </li> <li> taxpayer's full-time job with its rotating shift requirement and occasional weekend work severely limited the time he could devote to his outdoor recreation center activity, and promotional efforts and advertising were curtailed to avoid conflicts with the job. Taxpayer didn't have the time to try to operate the center profitably during the tax years involved. </li> <li> taxpayer, a full time taxicab driver, devoted approximately three hours to accounting work over a two year period. </li> </ul> </div>",

Other taxpayers, and their daughters, did most of the work done in their horse boarding/training activity, including sweeping and cleaning the stalls, feeding and grooming the horses, routine bookkeeping, and various other tasks. The occasional riding taxpayers did (i.e., once a month or less) also indicated that they weren't running an operation for their own recreation. Although their daughter enjoyed giving riding lessons and showing the horses, the stables weren't run for her personal pleasure. </li> <li> A locomotive engineer, who also had operated small businesses, moved to a 42-acre ranch where he and his wife planted alfalfa and raised cattle. They performed all of the farm work by themselves, including preparing the land for the alfalfa crop, renovating existing buildings, mending and installing fences, baling hay, and caring for the cattle. Later, taxpayers moved to a 249-acre ranch where they worked 8-10 hours per day in similar farming activities. </li> <li> A taxpayer entered into a land development venture and bought a bulldozer for use in the venture. Because of various legal problems, the taxpayer was unable to develop the land and was unsuccessful in finding a profitable use for the bulldozer. </li> <li> In addition to working a full-time job, taxpayer ran a cattle breeding operation requiring daily feeding of the cattle and other manual work. None of the tracts of land used in the taxpayer's farming operation contained any fishing streams, ponds, or any other recreational facilities. </li> <li> Taxpayer compressed his work schedule for his full-time job as a field engineer into four 10-hour days so that he could spend three consecutive days each week engaged in gold mining. He sacrificed entire weekends with his family to travel 150 miles into the desert alone to mine for gold, facing substantial risks of injury as well as numerous health risks. In view of the substantial time, energy, and financial support that gold mining requires, plus the substantial risk of injury and health problems (e.g., heat prostration, silicosis, cyanide poisoning) involved, any personal pleasure or recreation was secondary. </li> <li> Transporting between 20 to 100 pounds of x-rays from one hospital to another for overnight analysis and returning them by 8 o'clock the next morning could hardly be any normal person's idea of a hobby. </li> <li> Taxpayer testified that the aching back and blisters he acquired in renovating a house he owned weren't recreational. </li> <li> Although IRS emphasized the recreational aspects of breeding and showing dogs, the court found that few of taxpayer's hours spent running his dog grooming shop and caring for his show dogs could be considered recreational. Due to the time required by this work, he was deprived of most of the social and recreational benefits typically enjoyed by breeders of show dogs. </li> <li> Two boats held for charter were never used for pleasure or taxpayer's personal convenience. </li> <li> A husband and wife who raised and bred horses on their farm didn't ride the horses for personal pleasure. The husband worked full-time as a nurse anesthetist and, at the time of the trial, hadn't ridden a horse for ten years. The wife worked full-time in the horse activities, but was unable to ride because of heart problems, and a back injury resulting from a car accident. She had ridden some horses before her health problems arose, but only to prepare them for racing, sale, or show. </li> <li> A thoroughbred horse racing activity where the taxpayers had no affectionate attachment to horses, didn't use their horses or farm for recreation and could potentially recoup their nine years of losses with one successful foal (see ¶  M-5882 ), and other applicable reg factors (see ¶  M-5832 ) and the overall circumstances of the case indicated the activity was for profit. But where a taxpayer who showed she got no personal pleasure or recreation from her thoroughbred horse breeding and racing activities couldn't explain how she expected to recoup her substantial horse activity losses (more than $1.1 million), she had no profit motive. </li> <li> A professional scuba diver spent much of his spare time teaching others (for a fee) the techniques of scuba diving and underwater treasure hunting. His only sport diving was in connection with his teaching for a fee. The Tax Court held that taxpayer's personal treasure hunting wasn't recreational, but was engaged in with the expectation of making a profit. Moreover, the Tax Court noted that when the taxpayer was diving personally for treasure, he was never accompanied by a friend to make his venture more recreational. </li> <li> Taxpayer, who engaged in accounting, tax return preparation, and notary activities as a sideline to his main source of income (preparing budgets and supervising an accounting staff), had the requisite profit motive in carrying on those sideline activities. An accounting, tax return preparation, or notary service activity isn't the sort of activity from which an individual generally derives personal pleasure or recreation. </li> <li> Taxpayer's model airplane business was conducted for profit where she inherited it from her father, a hobbyist who started the business many years earlier. Taxpayer herself didn't derive personal pleasure from the activity. She didn't have substantial income from other sources to absorb losses, and wouldn't have continued the business without an honest expectation of profits. </li> <li> Taxpayer's cattle-raising activity consisted of long hours of grueling manual labor and didn't have the characteristics of a pleasureful or recreational hobby. With the exception of one deer hunt, taxpayer didn't use the farm for recreational purposes. </li> <li> Hand tinting photographs, based on orders derived from spare time solicitations. The taxpayer wasn't occasionally selling photographs to amuse herself. Rather, she dedicated her spare time to the activity, hoping to get out of the professional rut she felt she had fallen into. </li> </ul> </div>",

        "text": "<div>Losses from unforeseen or fortuitous circumstances, such as drought, disease, fire, other involuntary conversions, or depressed market conditions don't indicate that the activity isn't engaged in for profit for purposes of the rules discussed at ¶  M-5801 et seq. Thus, there was a profit motive where land was leased to sharecroppers during years that taxpayer was unable to operate it due to lack of farm equipment during the wartime and postwar shortages. </div>\n\n<div>Where a taxpayer, because of his failing health, was unable to devote a great deal of time or energy to his company's affairs, these circumstances explained why the company was not profitable, as opposed to establishing a lack of profit objective, especially in light of the company's earlier profitability and the taxpayer's success in taking steps to improve the company's performance in later years. </div>\n\n<div>A doctor (taxpayer), an avid sailor who previously had bought and sold a series of sailboats at a profit, had a profit motive for a yachting activity he engaged in with his professor-wife where an unfortunate combination of events prevented him from actually realizing a profit. He bought a 50-foot racing sailboat (at a bargain price) in order to join a sailing association that held annual races and promised sponsorship income to its members. He expected to profit by getting sponsorships, forming a franchise league for sailboat racing, boat chartering, and reselling the boat. The boat, which was crewed mostly by professionals, sailed in several races and chartered trips, and was featured in a clothing catalogue and a deodorant commercial. However, the drug companies taxpayer had expected as sponsors (because of his profession) came under Congressional investigation, the sailing association disbanded, he lost two principal charterers, the international racing rules changed, and the imposition of a luxury tax caused industry layoffs. Additionally, taxpayer was sidelined by bypass surgery and was beset by malpractice suits and other financial pressures, including embezzlement by his pension plan administrator, to the point where he couldn't keep the boat in first-class condition. </div>\n\n<div>On the other hand, a plastic surgeon (taxpayer) could have foreseen the excessive repair and restoration costs that resulted in the losses he claimed for activities relating to a luxury Feadship (top-of-the-line) yacht he bought knowing it was in a distressed condition. Although taxpayer had no expertise in owning, restoring or chartering yachts, or in buying them for resale, a good faith, diligent and timely investigation into the condition of the yacht and the nature of the luxury yacht charter business would have eliminated most of the surprise as to those costs, and would have given him the information necessary to make a reasoned and calculated attempt to make the venture profitable. </div>\n\n<div>A series of misfortunes didn't prevent finding a profit motive where taxpayer tried planting different crops on his farm, but sales were low due to competition from larger, more sophisticated farms. He attempted to raise cattle, but most of them died from an infection caused by a rare parasite in water they had been drinking. He tried to establish a duck preserve; however, the farm had no watershed of its own. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers, husband and wife, raised and bred horses on their farm “for profit” despite a history of losses. The losses were the result of unforeseen circumstances beyond taxpayers' control, and they adjusted their activities accordingly. Before heart problems and injuries from a car accident forced her to cut back, the wife spent about 35-40 hours a week managing the farm's day-to-day operations, and was also active in several horse industry organizations. When the husband lost his job as a nurse anesthetist, the couple filed for bankruptcy to protect and maintain their investment in the horse activity, and were required by the bankruptcy court to make monthly payments on the mortgage they had incurred to buy horses. A foal produced by taxpayers' prize-winning mare suffered a leg injury and had to be put to sleep. Failing to sell any horses, taxpayers planned to begin boarding and training horses, teaching classes, and operating a tack shop to sell horse equipment. The contractor they hired to build a large barn for use in those activities went bankrupt, so taxpayers built several smaller barns to reduce some of their boarding costs. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' horse breeding and racing operation was held to be an activity engaged in for profit, despite a consistent history of losses, where those losses were in part due to unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances beyond taxpayers' control which abruptly ended the racing careers, and in some instances the lives, of several of their horses. For example, five horses died in accidents at the racetrack, one died after producing a foal, two developed tendon problems, and one developed a flesh-eating disease. </div>\n\n<div>But in another case, taxpayers' claim that unforeseen circumstances, such as an injury to their stallion, a foal's death, and another horse's bowed tendon, caused the losses they sustained in their horse breeding activities for the years at issue failed to persuade the court that they had a profit motive for those activities. While taxpayers claimed that a horse expert had said the stallion would have been profitable if he hadn't been injured, the stallion's performance in competition was never better than the intermediate dressage level. It was unknown whether the stallion would have reached the highest dressage level if he hadn't been injured, or if taxpayers' horse operations would have been profitable absent the injuries to the other horses. Moreover, taxpayers failed to show that the actions they took to correct their operations after those unforeseen events were intended to make the horse breeding more profitable. Also, these events occurred at least five years before the first year at issue. Similarly, the unforeseen circumstances cited by taxpayers—characterized as mishaps and injuries that contributed to the failure of their first prize stallion to reach his full potential—did not satisfactorily account for the history of losses (for 23 of 26 years) from their horse-related activity (showing and breeding “cutting horses”) and, thus, taxpayers didn't prove a profit motive. The mishaps included colic suffered by the horse, remedial training required to reverse undesirable training given the horse by a hired trainer, ankle injuries suffered by taxpayer-wife (W) that kept her from riding for six months, a crippling leg injury suffered by the horse, and a failed attempt to lease the horse for breeding. However, the colic and retraining took place during the two years the taxpayers earned significant profits and the taxpayers didn't explain why they didn't seek another rider for the horse while W was injured. The court rejected taxpayers attempts to characterize their activity as a lengthy startup period (11 years) spent developing the first prize stallion's value, followed by the period of mishaps, and then by a lengthy period developing the value of a second prize stallion. </div>\n\n<div>Despite losses over several years, taxpayers' farm operation was an activity engaged in for profit. Taxpayers in the thoroughbred breeding business suffered unforeseen losses from a high rate of abortion in the brood mares, which occurred because the pastures on which they were grazing were contaminated with a toxic fungus. The taxpayers replanted 45 acres of pasture land at a substantial cost and purchased several well-bred mares to enhance its thoroughbred business. During this period, however, the entire southeast entered into a severe four-year drought. As a result, the first two or three efforts in reestablishing the pastures were unsuccessful. In addition, there was a drastic drop in the average and median prices for yearlings throughout the thoroughbred industry. Although the taxpayers experimented with new sources of revenue such as boarding polo ponies (which generated substantial revenues), this activity was hindered by the severe droughts, which limited the farm's grazing potential and the number of polo horses that could be boarded at any given time. Further, taxpayers lost one of their best clients, whose polo career ended when he was shot. </div>\n\n<div>Similarly, taxpayer's horse breeding operation was considered an activity engaged in for profit, even though taxpayer had suffered losses over several years, because some of the losses were due to unexpected setbacks. Taxpayer had tried to breed Paso Fino-quality horses, but when he realized that he didn't have the mares to do so and was instead merely selling “pleasure” and “performance” quality horses, he sought to improve his stable. But because one mare in stock always produced twin offspring (an undesirable trait in the Fino horse industry), taxpayer “pinched off” one of the mare's ovaries each time it was bred so it delivered only one offspring. This, and taxpayer's decision to use embryonic transfers (another expensive procedure), caused taxpayer to incur increased veterinary costs. After another of taxpayer's horses, purchased for $30,000, failed to meet expectations, taxpayer gelded it and then sold it for only $2,000. When another horse suffered a broken hoof after kicking its stall, taxpayer incurred $5,000 in veterinary bills in the hope of fixing the horse's gait and thus maintaining its value. And taxpayer was forced to euthanize a five-day-old foal with an arthritic condition. </div>\n\n<div>Severe unforeseeable weather conditions and taxpayer's attempts to make his farm land more productive were factors indicating that taxpayer had a profit motive. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's losses over 15 years of cattle farming didn't prove the absence of profit motive where they experienced two hurricanes, cattle disease, cattle food poisoning, and a drought. One taxpayer suffered allergic reactions from some of the farm work. They operated the farm in a business-like manner, followed the advice of experts, and devoted 40 hours per week each to working on the farm. </div>\n\n<div>Although taxpayer's farm produced losses for ten years in a row, much of his losses were caused by storms, diseases, and other unexpected events. He never used the farm as a showplace. He had operated another farm profitably. </div>\n\n<div>Another taxpayers' losses could be explained by the fact that three horses out of seven available for racing suffered broken knee or ankle bones, a promising horse bought for racing two years earlier proved to be of little value and was sold for a loss, and another promising horse developed the dangerous habit of running into its stall and was sold. </div>\n\n<div>Similarly, taxpayers had a profit motive for their show horse farm, although they suffered a severe setback when their most promising horse had to be destroyed. </div>\n\n<div>Where damage to the yacht prevented the tax year in question from being profitable, but the owner of the yacht chartering operation intended to make a profit, and actually made a small profit in the preceding tax year, the court ruled that a business won't be turned into a hobby merely because the owner finds it pleasurable. </div>\n\n<div>A ski lodge was an activity entered into for profit, despite eight years of losses, where, shortly after taxpayer entered the lodging market, it was saturated with competitors, there were a number of years of below average snowfall, and a gasoline shortage kept skiers away. </div>\n\n<div>A timber farm was a for-profit activity despite taxpayers' failure to cut and sell any of the timber during the years in issue. Soon after taxpayers bought the timber farm, timber prices fell dramatically in the U. S. and remained below the estimated costs petitioner would incur to harvest the timber. Accordingly, taxpayers postponed the cutting, harvesting, and sale of any of the standing timber on the timber farm. The court rejected IRS's argument that because of taxpayers' failure to cut and sell any of the timber during the years in issue, taxpayers' activity should be regarded only as startup activity, not an existing trade or business or for-profit activity. Typically, on a timber farm individual trees are harvested only once every 35 to 60 years. Nothing indicated that the taxpayers ever abandoned their profit objective with regard to the timber farm: they simply deferred cutting and selling the timber because of an unexpected decline in timber prices. </div>\n\n<div>Where taxpayer's rental apartment was in a run-down, high crime area, her inability to find a tenant for ten years didn't negate a profit motive. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer sustained losses every year from his jet charter service, but was held to have a profit motive in part because the losses were partly due to unforeseen safety problems with his jet. </div>\n\n<div>Similarly, the Tax Court found that taxpayer's airplane leasing business was operated for profit, despite a record of increasing losses. The first year loss wasn't surprising because the airplane wasn't available for service until December and was therefore rented for only a few hours of flying time. The losses in the two succeeding years were due to the deaths of a key employee and most of the pilots in an airplane crash. This ended nearly all charter activity at the airport and effectively doomed the enterprise but didn't disprove taxpayer's profit motive in the first year. </div>\n\n<div>In another airplane activities case, the taxpayer—who never reported a profit from his jet service activity during its six years' duration—claimed, unsuccessfully, that his losses from the activity were due to an unforeseen circumstance, namely the failure of an initial public offering (IPO) that would have resulted in a profitable level of need for his jet service. But, in fact, the losses were preventable by the taxpayer, as he had the option to sell back his interest in the jet after the failure of the IPO, and didn't do so. The court said the evidence showed that the taxpayer's keeping his interest in the jet—as well as his later trading up to a more expensive jet—reflected his decision that the convenience of personal travel by private jet, and perhaps the tax benefits of losses from the jet service activity, justified the costs of continuing ownership of the interest.</div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer entered into a land development venture and bought a bulldozer for use in the venture. Because of various legal problems, the taxpayer was unable to develop the land. The taxpayer attempted to find a profitable use for the bulldozer, but was unsuccessful. The inability to make a profit was due to unforeseen circumstances and didn't show a lack of a profit motive. Moreover, the taxpayer's attempt to sell the bulldozer didn't show that the taxpayer was withdrawing from the business, since, although the taxpayer was unable to rent the bulldozer, it remained available for rental. </div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer's continuing losses in his cattle-raising activity didn't indicate a lack of profit motive where some of the losses were due partly to drought and depressed market conditions. Economic constraints prevented him from entering into a planned stocker-calf operation (in which weaned calves are bought, fattened on pasture and sold for profit). To maximize his farmland's productivity, he went into a cow-calf operation (in which cows are bred and calves are sold). </div>\n\n<div>Another taxpayer had a profit motive although he was forced to reduce operations because of a labor shortage during war years. But a taxpayer's claim that losses of yacht chartering activity were due to unforeseen circumstances (repeated equipment failures and seller's and manufacturer's failures to correct the yacht's defects) was rejected. Taxpayer didn't conduct the preliminary investigation expected from someone motivated primarily in making a profit, that would have alerted him to the likelihood of some of the problems. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's argument that her growing losses in the operation of her bookkeeping and tax service were caused by the poor economic conditions and beyond her control was rejected because she didn't prove that poor economic conditions contributed to her losses. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' argument that losses from their dog-breeding activity were caused by progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retina that causes blindness in dogs, was rejected. Though the taxpayers asserted that this disease caused an unanticipated increase in expenses because they were required to purchase new stock for breeding, in fact, the taxpayers didn't know that any of their dogs even had PRA until after the years in issue. The taxpayers' losses were largely the result of the high cost of dog boarding and handling, and not from the purchase of breeding stock. PRA didn't have a significant impact on the taxpayers' dog-breeding activity during the tax years in question. </div>\n\n<div>The Sixth Circuit, reversing the Tax Court's finding that the taxpayers' activities were not engaged in for profit, held that beyond controversy the losses suffered by taxpayers engaged in fish farming, Christmas tree, timber, and row crop undertakings were caused at least in part by unanticipated, drought, heat, and deer damage during the years at issue. The Tax Court had rejected this argument because the taxpayers didn't attempt to quantify losses attributable to each cause, and didn't specify whether the drought took place during the years in which they had or had not planted crops. In addition, the Tax Court reasoned that while the taxpayers alleged that farmers in the area suffered from deer depredation, not only did they not introduce evidence that deer damage contributed to their losses, evidence suggested that there were salt licks on the property to attract deer and other animals. On the other hand, the Six Circuit reasoned that evidence that salt licks and feed boxes had been placed on the taxpayers' farm in no way proved the inherently absurd speculation that the taxpayers had deliberately schemed to destroy their crops by attracting ravenous deer onto their farm. To the contrary, the taxpayers' activities could have been more logically construed to lure deer away from the crops, to areas where they could be easily hunted, in order to promoting the well being of the taxpayers' farm. </div>\n\n<div>A decline in the horse breeding market wasn't an unforeseen circumstance where the taxpayer failed to conduct even a basic investigation of the profitability of horse breeding before beginning the activity. Therefore, the taxpayer couldn't use the purportedly unexpected decline in market conditions to support his position that he had a profit motive with respect to the activity. </div>\n\n<div>A taxpayer couldn't explain away her substantial losses (more than $1.1 million over 14 years) from breeding, raising and racing thoroughbred horses by arguing that unforeseen events negatively affected her activities, where she took no steps to put herself in a position to earn the substantial profit necessary to recoup those losses. The events taxpayer cited—death of one broodmare, barren broodmare, poor performance of racing thoroughbreds, and negative economic conditions—were not of a type that should have caught her by surprise. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers argued that their nearly 20 years of losses in cattle-raising and deer-herding activities were due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control—namely, price fluctuations and drought conditions during that period. The Tax Court found that, on the basis of climate and meteorological data, no drought seems to have occurred during the period and in the region at issue, and that, even if drought had occurred there, that the “unforeseen circumstances” were not in fact unforeseen. Taxpayer-husband was raised on a cattle ranch in the part of the country where he conducted his operations, and knew or should have known that the region was susceptible to drought, and that beef prices often fluctuated. </div>\n\n<div class='match' >The unforeseen or fortuitous event must cause the loss or losses at issue in order to be a factor favorable to the taxpayer claiming the loss. Thus, a taxpayer couldn't rely, as a reason for his losses, on the lameness of a horse which he acquired and was training, supposedly for sale at a profit, where the taxpayer couldn't prove that he intended to sell the horse, the value of the horse at the time it went lame or the profit that would have been made on the supposed sale (taking into account the original purchase price of the horse and the cumulative expenses associated with it). For a summary of the multiple factors taken into account by the Tax Court in concluding that the horse breeding and training activity in Drummond (footnote 28.1) wasn't engaged in for profit, see ¶  M-5892 . Similarly, a hurricane that caused damage to property taxpayer owned in another state and misfortunes suffered in taxpayer's computer service business were only tangentially related to taxpayer's cattle ranching activity and thus weren't unforeseen circumstances responsible for the continued (seven year) losses from the cattle ranching activity. The hurricane damage was, in fact, resolved within a relatively short period, impacting only one winter. And, because taxpayer's level of involvement in ranch affairs remained the same before and after the reverses to his computer business, they were not a convincing reason for losses suffered on the ranch. Nor, were drought conditions in the area of the ranch unforeseen circumstances excusing losses since taxpayer knew of the lack of rainfall in the area before purchasing the land he used for grazing. Thus, taxpayer should have been aware of the need to plan for such conditions if he truly intended to make a profit from his property. Rather, seven years after the purchase of the land, an irrigation system was still not in place. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer argued his efforts to earn a profit from his farm were hampered when one of his horses fell into a ditch and died, and when cougars and an English bulldog killed some of his sheep and pygmy angora goats. He also argued that his fir trees had a long growing cycle, thus delaying a harvest. But taxpayer's farm losses were disallowed. No profits were realized in five years of operations. Taxpayer and his wife spent just 10 to 20 hours a week working on the farm. And all meat they “harvested” from their animals was consumed; none was sold. </div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer should have known that his activity of metal mining and refining involved dangerous or hazardous chemicals subject, at least to a minimal degree, to environmental regulation and that therefore environmental compliance would be a cost of doing business rather than an unforeseeable circumstance preventing him from making a profit. </div>",

        "text": "<div>Under the hobby loss rules, deductions attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit are limited, see ¶  M-5800 et seq. All facts and circumstances must be taken into account in determining whether an activity's engaged in for profit, see ¶  M-5832 et seq.</div>\n\n<div>Losses that continue beyond the period usually necessary for an activity to become profitable may indicate the activity isn't engaged in for profit, particularly where taxpayer takes no steps to increase profitability and other factors indicate that the activity isn't engaged in for profit.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's cattle ranching activities weren't engaged in for profit, despite the considerable amount of time spent on the those activities, and despite the fact that taxpayer had only moderate income from other sources. Taxpayer began reporting the activity in '82, and never reported a net profit. Moreover, taxpayer presented no credible evidence that he had any real plan for reversing the continuous stream of losses from the activity.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' cattle-raising and deer-herding activities showed a profit only once in 20 years, and the record indicated that the losses from these operations would continue for the foreseeable future. These factors suggested that taxpayers didn't engage in those activities with a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers who had engaged in horse breeding activities for at least 22 years, with a net loss of at least $217,356 during a six-year period that included the years at issue, didn't have a profit motive. They didn't even come close to generating a profit from those activities during any of the years at issue. Similarly, a taxpayer whose cumulative losses from breeding, raising and racing thoroughbreds over an 18-year period exceeded $888,000 didn't engage in those activities for profit. The start-up phase of a horse breeding activity is five to 10 years, and the years in issue were well beyond that period.</div>\n\n<div>A farm, which had increasing losses despite business-like manner with which the operation was carried out, was found to be an activity not engaged in for profit. The business-like management and efforts to improve efficiency were done to diminish the losses of a hobby.</div>\n\n<div>And, the most compelling factors indicating that taxpayers didn't engage in their horse-related activities (showing and breeding “cutting horses”) with a profit objective was their history of losses—23 of 26 years, averaging $40,000 per year for the last seven years of the activity—and their failure to make any significant attempts to modify their method of operation to improve profitability, even though the losses had been continuous for the last 15 years of the activity. Similarly, the fact that the taxpayer reported a loss from her horse breeding activities for each of the 12 years she reported those activities was a significant factor in the court's refusal to find a profit motive. The taxpayer's total loss for that period was $749,338, while her total income was $60,838. While acknowledging that the start-up period for horse breeding could last up to 10 years, the Tax Court, and the Eleventh Circuit on appeal, noted that the taxpayer reported losses of over $60,000 in both the eleventh and twelfth years of her horse breeding activity.</div>\n\n<div>Where the taxpayer was bound to incur losses for several years under the terms of a lease of property he owned, there was no profit motive for the activity. This situation was different than the usual “start up” activities when early losses are expected, but where effort and imagination can make the venture profitable.</div>\n\n<div>Another taxpayer's history of losses was the most persuasive evidence that his boat charter activity wasn't engaged in for profit. Taxpayer, who enjoyed sailing for personal pleasure, bought a sailboat and enrolled it in a charter fleet on Lake Superior. The court acknowledged that the taxpayers carried on the activity in a business-like manner (see ¶  M-5834 et seq.), had the necessary personal expertise to engage in a sailboat charter business (see ¶  M-5852 et seq.), expended reasonable time and effort in carrying on the activity (see ¶  M-5860 et seq.), and had a reasonable expectation that the sailboat might appreciate in value (see ¶  M-5868 ). Nevertheless, the deductions were denied because the taxpayers received no profits from the activity and couldn't expect to receive any. The only cash flow they could expect from the activity was from tax benefits.</div>\n\n<div>Where a full-time commercial airline pilot (taxpayer) who also engaged in his own airline activities (building airplanes from kits and then selling them) consistently reported substantial net losses from those activities, the losses (ranging from $37,881 to $102,607 over an 11-year period) were “highly indicative” of a lack of profit motive. The taxpayer used those losses to offset the significant wages he earned the airline, and his taxable pension and annuity income of approximately $183,400 per year.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' history of “substantial” or “huge” losses from their horse activities—well over $300,000 per year for eight years—belied any notion that the activities were operated for profit. Any bona fide expectation of profit that taxpayers might have had at the outset no longer existed, in light of those recurring losses.</div>\n\n<div>There was no profit motive where taxpayer failed to make a profit in 15 years of part-time stock car racing, five years of drag racing, 15 years of dog breeding, 36 out of 37 years of farming, 11 years of maintenance activity, 10 years of software development activity (writing and debugging programs for an obsolete computer), or seven years of gold mining activities (not including the years spent prospecting).</div>\n\n<div>The taxpayers lacked a profit objective with respect to their horse breeding and racing activity where they claimed disproportionate loss deductions for all four tax years of the operation of the activity (the activity produced $285 in gross receipts and $35,492 in losses during the tax years at issue). Despite this financial history, taxpayer made no attempt to improve profitability by devising new methods of operations or business plans.</div>\n\n<div>Similarly, taxpayer's standardbred horse breeding and racing operation wasn't an activity engaged in for profit where there was a consistent history of losses and a lack of evidence showing that taxpayer investigated or evaluated the factors affecting the profitability of the operation, developed profit plans or break-even analyses or consulted experts on how to make the operation profitable. The taxpayer's failure to establish these facts could be explained by his lack of concern over them, because he had more than sufficient income as a doctor and consultant, especially taking account of the tax savings generated by the losses.</div>\n\n<div>That taxpayers had realized “no profits whatsoever” during more than 25 years of horse breeding, training, and racing activities was a strong indication they weren't engaged in those activities for profit. Although taxpayers argued that the losses had been caused by factors beyond their control (injury, illness, and death of a number of their horses and the failure of legislation that would have allowed video lottery terminals [slot machines] at horse racing tracks), they failed to show that the activities would have been profitable without those events. And while the Tax Court acknowledged the “highly speculative” nature of horse racing, breeding, and training, it stated that the events cited by taxpayers hardly accounted for their “unbroken string” of more than 25 years of losses. Further, although taxpayers cited the potential to earn a substantial profit with one outstanding horse, that contention—the possibility of a speculative profit—wasn't enough to outweigh the absence of profits for a sustained period of years.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's five-year history of increasing losses from his automobile racing activity indicated a lack of profit objective where he took no steps to increase profitability despite the persistent losses. He never considered participating in a greater number of races at the track near his home, nor did he make any effort to race in tracks farther away from his home, even though they awarded considerably higher prize money. Moreover, the taxpayer didn't expand his efforts to get sponsors to offset some of his expenses.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's “persistent and significant” losses of $570,000 from his car-racing activities over an eight-year span were a key factor in the determination that it wasn't a profit-seeking activity for him. The racing activity was a tool that helped increase taxpayer's income from selling communications equipment, thereby lessening his concern over whether profits or losses were generated by it. Taxpayer kept accurate records, but only to satisfy the tax requirements and not as a tool to achieve profitability. He invested heavily in capital assets for the activity and got marketing materials from a design firm, but these factors were consistent with IRS's theory that it was merely taxpayer's “expensive hobby.” The Tax Court also found taxpayer's claim that he no longer derived personal enjoyment from racing cars (“the thrill is gone”) to lack credibility.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers' tournament fishing activity wasn't for profit where they incurred almost $1.5 million in expenses to win $500,000 in prizes. They suffered losses for four straight years, but took no meaningful action to reverse the trend. Similarly, a taxpayer's tournament fishing activity was held to be not for profit in light of continued losses that appeared to indicate that a timeframe for profit was irrelevant. The taxpayer also failed to change his operating methods in a manner that might lead to a profitable result.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer, a full-time financial analyst, wasn't engaged in a sailboat chartering activity with a profit objective where: evidence of his tax motivation was undisputed; the activity had a five-year loss history; and the losses, rather than resulting from unpredictable events, had been projected by the taxpayer. The Tax Court, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, reached this conclusion even though taxpayer had conducted the activity in a businesslike manner.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer, a practicing lawyer, had no profit objective in his horse racing/breeding activities. A principal factor that led the Tax Court to this conclusion was taxpayer's continuing pattern of losses and his failure to keep businesslike records (see ¶  M-5834 ). The court also noted that, although taxpayer's ultimate goal was to make a living with horse racing/breeding and farming activities, he didn't abandon his lucrative legal practice.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's 20-year history of losses from his photography and art activity, during which period there were almost no sales, and his casual approach to marketing, led the Tax Court to conclude that the taxpayer lacked a profit objective. The taxpayer argued that his persistence and dedication to this activity was proof of his profit objective. But the Tax Court said that this persistence suggested a great dedication to art but none to business concerns such as earning a profit.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's eight consecutive years of losses, ending with the tax year at issue, in the activity of metal mining and refining accompanied by no steps to increase his income or decrease his expenses was a factor showing no profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Similarly, substantial losses from activities as distributors in every year in which taxpayers engaged in those activities (the eight years before the year of the Tax Court trial, plus projected losses for the year in which that trial took place) indicated that taxpayers weren't engaged in those activities with a profit motive.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer's five-year history of losses in her direct-marketing activities indicated the absence of a profit motive. The court rejected taxpayer's argument that the early losses were merely start-up losses caused by her having to switch companies due to unforeseen circumstances. The unforeseen circumstance was the state's shutting down one venture marketing a “tax relief system.” And, in any event, she shifted from activity to activity without analyzing costs or earnings potential. So, the losses were operating losses and not start-up losses. It also wasn't significant that in later years she showed a small profit, because this was attributable to taxpayer's ceasing to claim questionable deductions such as home office expenses and wages paid to her sons.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayer lacked a profit motive where the gross receipts from his Amway distributorship greatly increased (from $20,000 to $100,000) over a four-year period, but net losses of $20,000 a year persisted due to increases in cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Even though taxpayer spent a lot of time on the activity, he was motivated by personal considerations such as discounts he got on products for personal use and use in his other businesses.</div>\n\n<div>Taxpayers, a married couple, didn't have a profit motive for their Amway distributorship where increasingly large yearly net losses greatly exceeded their annual gross receipts.</div>\n\n<div>On the other hand, mere failure to make a profit doesn't, by itself, indicate that the taxpayer isn't engaged in a trade or business.</div>\n\n<div>The Tax Court originally held, in a “close call,” that taxpayer conducted her gambling activities with a profit motive in 2004 and 2005, despite losses each year. Other sources of income were disposed of, and her gambling activities were regular and continuous. Taxpayer was allowed to claim her gambling losses (up to the amount of her gambling winnings, see ¶  M-6101 ) on Schedule C instead of Schedule A ( ¶  M-6105 ). But once taxpayer's history of substantial losses continued through 2008, the Tax Court held no profit motive existed for those later years, so she was no longer in a trade or business as of 2006.</div>\n\n<div class='match' >The following activities were engaged in for profit despite a history of losses: <ul> <li> an oil and gas venture where the taxpayer received only $140,000 on a $6,250,000 highly risky investment in oil and gas leases and deducted $4,500,000 in the same year on account of abandonment or worthlessness of the underlying leases. </li> <li> a joint venture organized for the purpose of putting together oil and mining deals in exchange for commissions, even though the venture was unsuccessful in putting together any deals and made no money. </li> <li> a dog kennel operated by a taxpayer in the coal business. </li> <li> sickness and death benefits paid by a fraternal organization in excess of dues. </li> <li> a granite quarry enterprise where there was no adequate access route to the quarry, but taxpayer hoped that someday one would be built. </li> <li> sculpting and painting activities. A history of losses is less persuasive in the art field than in other fields. Many artists have to struggle before they make profits or receive public acclaim that results in an increase in the value of their artwork. So, taxpayer's ten year history of losses didn't prove that she engaged in her art activities without the requisite profit motive. </li> <li> a horse breeding activity that had losses in each of the six years at issue. Drought and a decreased market for horses contributed to the losses. Taxpayer had taken steps to improve profitability, and expected to realize a profit once he established a viable stock of horses for breeding. In fact, the activity showed a profit later. </li> <li> horse breeding and racing activities, where, although taxpayers had a consistent history of losses, they abated their losses over time and were capable of making up their losses from earlier years, because their horses were beginning to be entered in high stakes races. </li> <li> a rodeo and horse breeding and training business, where the taxpayers, an airline pilot and a flight attendant, respectively, had losses in the first two years due to circumstances beyond their control. IRS said that the death and illnesses of some horses and the manager's bad conduct were due to taxpayers' absences, but the court held that they reasonably relied on a qualified manager during their absences. </li> <li> a cattle farm operation, where taxpayer's losses for the years at issue could be partially explained by uncontroverted proof of a decline in cattle sales, and taxpayer's poor health. And while taxpayer's cumulative losses from the farm over the years were substantial, those losses became less significant in light of the substantial appreciation in the farmland's value. Taxpayer also experimented with different farming methods in an effort to increase profitability. </li> <li> a farming activity that taxpayer conducted on 15 acres of overgrown pasture and 15 acres of a deteriorated citrus grove. Although he made the citrus grove into one of the finest in the area, taxpayer wasn't able to make a profit. Citrus growers in the state hadn't made a profit for the last 20 to 25 years. Although the taxpayer's expectation of profit from the farming activity was unreasonable, the court believed that the taxpayer had a bona fide profit objective. He was no more unreasonable than all other citrus growers in the area. </li> <li> a limousine service, where taxpayer had losses for six consecutive years. Most of the losses were attributable to depreciation, and taxpayer believed that the Rolls Royces used in the business would increase in value or hold their value. </li> <li> a jet charter service in which taxpayer incurred substantial losses every year he operated the business (13). Taxpayer conducted the operation in a business-like manner, devoted 30 hours a week to it, relied on skilled experts, and had great success in other business ventures. He wasn't an airplane hobbyist. Losses were due in part to unforeseen circumstances and he made appropriate changes in the business to try to improve the situation. The court also noted that the losses grew progressively smaller over time and cash flow increased. </li> <li> a hair-braiding salon that never showed a profit during eight years of operation, where the taxpayer had a genuine profit motive when she opened the business, and it failed for reasons beyond her control (i.e., the 2008–2010 financial crisis, an over-concentration of similar businesses, and a change in taste among customers). She didn't close the business earlier because she was bound by a long-term rental contract, and wanted to protect her credit rating. Taxpayer had only a modest income from her other job, and suffered genuine out-of-pocket losses. She kept business records and made reasonable marketing efforts. The salon was no hobby. </li> </ul> </div>",
